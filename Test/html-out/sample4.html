Directors' report // Business review // Chairman's statement
</p>
<p id="page6p3" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
This is my first report to shareholders having succeeded Martin Adamson as Chairman in April and I am pleased to be able to report another good performance.
Considerable progress was made in the development of the group during the year with significant capital expenditure, the restructuring of a number of businesses and growth in adjusted earnings per share of 5%. All of this was achieved against a background of a worldwide economic slow-down, with many of the countries in which we operate in recession.
</p>
<p id="page6p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
The fact that we have been able to continue with our high level of capital investment despite these economic conditions is a testament to the strength of the group's balance sheet and our ability to generate cash. A number of major long-term projects are under way including the restructuring of our meat business in Australia, the combining of Jordans and Ryvita in the UK, the creation of a packaged edible oil joint venture in North America, capacity expansions for Sugar and Ingredients in southern Africa, Europe and China, the building of the Vivergo biofuels facility in the UK and further new stores for Primark across Europe.
Such investment benefits today's stakeholders but must also serve their interests tomorrow. Accordingly, our capital investment also addresses reduction in energy and water usage and promotes greater use of renewable fuels in our factories.
The major infrastructure projects, particularly in the developing world, will provide local employment opportunities and a whole range of other social benefits.
Group revenue increased by 12% to £9.3bn and adjusted operating profit was up 8% to £720m. With over 50% of the group's revenue and profit arising outside the UK, the weakness of sterling had a favourable currency translation effect on these results. Good trading was delivered by a number of our businesses, most notably from sugar in the UK and Africa, Allied Bakeries and Primark. However, the difficulties experienced by our Chinese sugar operations and the North American edible oils business, evident in our half year results, held back profit for the full year.
Primark continues to deliver excellent growth in both revenue and profit, achieved through strong UK like-for-like sales growth and the addition of further retail selling space. Whilst there are still many opportunities to extend Primark's estate in the UK and Ireland, expansion into continental Europe represents an exciting and substantial growth prospect for this highly successful business.
Our European sugar operations have emerged from regime reform and profit is returning to more acceptable levels. For a relatively modest net investment, we strengthened our position in European sugar with the acquisition of Azucarera Ebro, the leading sugar producer in Iberia, and the disposal of our smaller sugar business in Poland. Azucarera will provide EU refining capacity for cane raws imported from least developed countries and is expected to be earnings accretive after the first year. Illovo delivered an excellent operating result and continues to explore the significant organic expansion opportunities available in Africa.

</p>
<p id="page7p3" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
The profitability of our Chinese sugar businesses was severely affected by low sugar prices in the first half of the year but these saw some recovery in the second half.
Profitable development of the beet sugar business in north east China is dependent on agricultural improvements and factory efficiencies which will take a number of years to achieve.
The challenges experienced by our grocery businesses last year from extreme movements in commodity costs were not repeated but were replaced instead by the pressures of trading in a recessionary environment. Although results in the first half were significantly affected by the losses sustained on high-priced US corn oil futures contracts, the second half performance was much better. There was some evidence of consumers trading down to cheaper products, but the group's major grocery brands, particularly Kingsmill, held up well.
A notable landmark in the development of the group's cash-generating ability is the achievement of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £1bn. Together with a reduction in working capital during the year, reflecting an increased management focus and lower commodity prices, this provided the funds for net capital expenditure and investment in new businesses of £832m including debt assumed and net of disposals.
The events in the financial markets since last year end have turned an accounting surplus in our defined benefit pension schemes last September of £61m into a deficit of £106m. This deficit is somewhat reduced from the position at the half year and, in the context of the group's resources, is manageable. It will nevertheless have a detrimental effect on other financial income in the coming year.
Net debt at the end of the year was £999m despite the substantial level of investment. The completion of the US private placement earlier in the year raised some US$600m, lengthened our debt maturity profile and diversified our sources of financing. The group now has a very comfortable level of headroom on its committed bank facilities. This provides a sound platform for continued investment.

<p id="page7p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Board changes
</p>
<p id="page7p5" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
I began my report by referring to Martin Adamson's retirement in April this year.
Martin served on the board for almost ten years, of which more than six were as Chairman, and in that time steered the group through a period of considerable change. Revenue was doubled. The trading footprint of the group was increased from 16 countries to 44 and our worldwide workforce tripled with the substantial investments in Africa, China and Primark. Martin's extensive business experience and sound judgement have been of immeasurable benefit to the board and we greatly appreciate the substantial contribution he has made to the group's success over the last decade. We wish him a long and happy retirement.

<p id="page7p6" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Employees
</p>
<p id="page7p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
It is pleasing during a time of worldwide recession and widespread unemployment to be able to report a small increase in the size of our workforce. The growth of the business has resulted in the number of our employees now exceeding 96,000 and I would like to thank them for their dedication and hard work. The trading environment over the past year has been difficult and the success of the group is a tribute to their commitment and enthusiasm.

Dividends

A final dividend of 14.1p is proposed, to be paid on 8 January 2010 to shareholders on the register on 4 December 2009. Together with the interim dividend of 6.9p paid on 3 July 2009, this will make a total of 21.0p for the year, an increase of 4%.

<p id="page7p10" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Outlook
</p>
<p id="page7p11" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
The likely scale and speed of economic recovery remains uncertain, and we are cautious about the outlook for the UK consumer over the next year. However, we expect good revenue and operating profit growth with the benefit of returns from our recent long-term investments and restructuring together with improvement in our Chinese and US businesses. Net financing costs will be higher but we are confident of progress in earnings for the full year.

The group delivered satisfactory results at a time when economic uncertainty and declining consumer spending presented our businesses with considerable challenges. Group revenue increased by 12% to £9.3bn and adjusted operating profit increased by 8% to £720m. Sugar, Primark and Ingredients delivered major improvements in profit, and Agriculture traded well and matched the exceptional performance of last year. Grocery was more affected and its profit decline was mainly attributable to long positions in vegetable oil futures taken out in the first half by ACH at values well above market. Sterling's weakness had a beneficial effect on the translation of profits from our overseas businesses.
Over the years we have developed the group through a combination of capital investment, process improvement, building new revenue streams and the acquisition of complementary businesses. Despite the economic environment, this year proved to be no exception and, if anything, the pace of activity increased with capital investment at a high level. All of our businesses have been strengthened as a result and are better equipped to deliver growth in the future.
In Sugar, the changes to the EU regime are now behind us and the market has been more stable. There has been much change and consolidation of producers in recent years. Our leading positions in the UK and Iberia, together with access to sugars from least developed countries, position us well for the EU market over the next few years. We expect volume growth from our African and Chinese operations over the coming years. Illovo has ambitious expansion plans and the doubling of capacity in Zambia was completed this year. Although profitability was held back by low prices in China, the addition of another mill in southern China expands this consistently profitable operation. Some progress was made in the beet sugar business in the north east of China but much remains to be achieved in improving agricultural yields and factory efficiency.
Primark had a remarkable year. Like-for-like growth of 7% demonstrated the strong development of its consumer franchise, particularly in the UK. The potential of continental Europe for the Primark model was even more evident this year and we are committed to expansion in Spain and the Netherlands. Early signs in Germany and Portugal are encouraging.
Development of our Grocery businesses was held back by the problems at ACH in the first half. However, it is noteworthy that considerable work was undertaken this year with integration work in our meat business in Australia, Patak's and Blue Dragon, Jordans and Ryvita and Stratas in the US. Each of these businesses will emerge much stronger.
Capacity expansion was the major feature in Ingredients with investment in enzymes, yeast and yeast extracts all of which have demonstrated their growth potential in recent years.
A number of long-term capital projects are in progress across the group, many of which are expected to complete during 2010. They will contribute to the continued growth of our businesses.

The results from Sugar moved substantially ahead this year with both revenue and profit increasing by 24%. This was achieved by a sharp recovery in profit at British Sugar UK, reversing the trend of declines in recent years, and continued growth by Illovo which more than offset disappointing results in China.
</p>
<p id="page9p10" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
In the EU, our UK and Polish businesses increased profit with good factory operating performances, robust sales, the benefit of a strong euro, a reduction in the restructuring levy and favourable energy costs. Very favourable growing conditions in the UK yielded an excellent beet crop with sugar per hectare at record levels and 1.19 million tonnes of sugar was produced. Factory operations benefited from further improvements in energy efficiency, returns from prior year investments and high sugar extraction rates. The contribution from the combined heat and power generation plants at Bury and Wissington increased with the supply of electricity to the grid at high prices. The business in Poland delivered a strong commercial performance which more than offset lower sugar production of 163,000 tonnes. Restructuring work at our closed factory sites in York, Dobre and Ostrawite proceeded to plan and the associated renunciation compensation of €116m was received in full from the European Commission in June 2009.
Following the renunciation of quota across the EU in 2008, supply and demand of sugar in the market has been broadly balanced. This has led to more stability for pricing. The final changes relating to reform of the EU sugar regime took place at the beginning of October 2009 and no further changes are anticipated until the next review which is expected to be implemented from October 2015.
A number of developments during the year strengthened our presence in the EU
market. We acquired Azucarera Ebro, the leading sugar producer in Iberia, in April this year. It operates from four beet factories, three in the north of Spain and one in the south. A sugar refinery is being commissioned on the site of the southern factory, given its proximity to the port of Cadiz, and it will have the capacity to produce 400,000 tonnes of sugar. The supply of cane raws is expected to be primarily from Illovo. In August we announced that we had reached agreement to sell our Polish sugar business, the country's fourth largest producer, to Pfeifer &amp; Langen. Completion, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected in late 2009. During the year British Sugar established a joint venture with Illovo, Mitra
Sugar, to source sugars from outside the EU and market them to companies within the EU. As a result of our leading positions in the UK and now in Iberia, together with access to the sugars of the least developed countries, we have a strong platform for the future.
Illovo delivered an excellent operating result driven by strong sales. These resulted from higher local market prices, currency translation gains for the operations outside South Africa and by recovery of the world sugar price. Sugar production was lower than expected at 1.9 million tonnes, with poor weather conditions in South Africa impacting the cane crop and excessive rains and early commissioning difficulties impacting volume throughput at the expanded mill in Zambia.
In contrast Malawi had another excellent year with good production volumes and operating performances.

Understanding the bigger picture is an essential component of British Sugar
Group's successful strategy which has seen its revenue grow from £700m to £1.6bn in four years.
</p>
<p id="page11p2" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
A prime example of this strategic vision has been in its adaptation to the EU's decision to allow duty-free imports of raw sugar from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) from 1 October 2009. By stimulating trade between the EU and many of the world's poorest countries, this policy is designed to aid economic development.
</p>
<p id="page11p3" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
At the same time, the European Commission also realised that many LDCs lacked the infrastructure to take advantage of these new trading opportunities. Take Swaziland for example. Here subsistence agriculture employs 70% of the population and overgrazing, soil depletion and drought are real problems.
</p>
<p id="page11p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
In response, the EU invested in programmes such as the construction of an irrigation dam and canal system at Lubovane.
Opened in March 2009, it allows local
</p>
<p id="page11p5" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
farmers to grow higher value crops, including sugar cane.
</p>
<p id="page11p6" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
But growing crops is only one part of the story, which is where British Sugar Group comes in. Illovo is working closely with local farmers and smallholders to grow cane, which in turn has justified the expansion of the Ubombo factory. Alongside this there are plans to generate more renewable energy from the cane biomass with the surplus electricity feeding into Swaziland's national grid.
</p>
<p id="page11p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
In Europe, British Sugar and Illovo established Mitra Sugar, a trading company which acts as a bridge between LDC sugar producers seeking to export to the EU and

AB Agri had another very strong year continuing to perform well above expectations in a market that experienced lower commodity prices but with continued volatility. Growth was achieved both in its UK and international operations, driven by good market experience, trading and nutritional expertise and by excellent performances from new business streams.
</p>
<p id="page12p8" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Frontier, our grain and crop inputs supply joint venture, produced exceptional results having anticipated the correction in the value of the global grain markets and the increased demand for seed, fertiliser and crop protection products.
In a quite different market from the previous year, Frontier's unique national grain trading structure and its integrated crop inputs supply business enabled it to respond quickly to changing customer demand. Its national network for grain trading and exporting facilities was ideally suited to merchandising the UK crop which was not only large but also of variable quality.
KW Trident, our ruminant feeds business, significantly increased its presence in the UK blends market. AB Vista delivered excellent sales growth of its high-technology, valued-added feed enzymes, and a new enzyme, Econase XT, was recently granted approval by the European Food Safety Authority. International sales of our other specialist products, pre-mixes and piglet starter feeds, continued to grow, particularly in the developing markets of Eastern Europe.
As part of our sustainable supply chain offerings to processors and retailers, AB Agri has developed the first Carbon Trust accredited greenhouse gas reduction model for dairy farms. This has been used to help Sainsbury reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from its milk-supplying farms. Sainsbury has recently signed an agreement with AB Agri to extend this carbon-scoring work to include beef, lamb, pork, poultry and eggs in its UK supply chain. This will require AB Agri to carbon footprint more than 18,000 farms over the next four years.
We continued to invest in our compound feed business in China. We opened a new mill in Henan province to meet this market's high demand for pig feed, replacing an old leased mill, and began construction of a new ruminant-specific mill in Tianjin. When complete, this expansion will have delivered a 20% increase in production capacity.
</p>
<p id="page12p9" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Our business in Zambia achieves the highest cane yield per hectare of any of Illovo's operations at levels which are world class. During the year we completed the doubling of capacity in Zambia as well as smaller-scale expansion projects in Swaziland, Mozambique and Tanzania. Streamlining of the South African business continued with the sale of the Umfolozi and Pongola mills and creation of a new joint venture at Gledhow. Illovo successfully raised rand 3bn of additional capital through a rights issue to finance its future expansion plans. Proceeds were received in late September after the group's year end. The Zambian business completed a US$50m rights issue during the year to finance its capacity increase.
Our businesses in China had a very difficult year with the significant sugar stock overhang from 2007/8 depressing prices during the first half. A reduced crop in the north, with exceptionally low sugar content, impacted operating costs. Sugar prices in China rallied in the second half driven by government purchases, a smaller national crop this year and higher world sugar prices. Importantly for the price outlook, consumption exceeded production in China by some 1.7 million tonnes in 2008/9. Looking forward the business will be strengthened by the commissioning of the new cane sugar mill at Jinchengjiang and by the beet sugar business focusing on the development of agriculture and production in seven of its 12 factories.
Construction of Vivergo's wheat bioethanol plant is progressing well at Hull in the UK, with commissioning now planned for autumn 2010. All major plant items have now been received and installation is well under way. Contracts have been signed with AB Agri to supply wheat from Frontier and for the sale of the distillers' grain co-products. It is expected that a yeast supply agreement with AB Mauri will be signed shortly. The European market for bioethanol is still in its infancy but is expected to grow considerably over the next few years. The UK mandate for the inclusion of renewables in transport fuel requires the current 3.25% to increase to 5% by 2013/14. Longer term, the EU Renewable Energy Directive will require the member states to derive 10% of transport fuel from renewable sources

Primark celebrates its 40th birthday this year and Arthur Ryan, its founder and chief executive throughout its rise to become a leading force on the high street, has chosen this landmark to announce that he will stand down as chief executive to concentrate on his role as Chairman. Responsibility for the day-to-day running of the business has been assumed by Paul Marchant as chief executive. Mr Marchant was appointed chief operating officer in January and brings with him a wealth of experience in retailing. Since then, he has worked closely with Mr Ryan and the strong management team. Mr Ryan's skill and experience will play an important part in maintaining the growth momentum and pursuing the significant strategic opportunities available to this business.
</p>
<p id="page14p9" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Primark again delivered exceptional sales and profit growth even though each of its three main markets were subject to recessionary pressure and a decline in consumer confidence.
Sales increased by 20% as a result of growth in selling space and like-for-like sales growth of 7%. The value sector continued to capture an increasing share of the UK clothing retail market and Primark is in the vanguard of this movement. Organic growth was also achieved through Primark's strong competitive position, its highly appealing merchandise and better weather than last year.
</p>
<p id="page14p10" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Operating profit margin declined from 12.1% to 10.9% this year, primarily as a result of the increased fixed overhead of the new UK distribution centre at Thrapston. The weakness of sterling during the year significantly increased the cost of goods sourced in US dollars. As a result of forward buying of currency, this mainly affected the second half of the financial year. However, the impact on gross margins was mitigated by better buying, lower freight costs and a more profitable sales mix. A further gross margin reduction is expected for the forthcoming period up to Christmas but with an improvement at the beginning of 2010 with the benefit of forward buying of US dollars at improved exchange rates.
We opened 12 new stores during the year: five in Spain, four in the UK and our first stores in each of the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal. We closed smaller stores in Bristol and Tooting when the new stores were opened there. The new Bristol store is our second largest after Manchester, trading from 100,000 sq ft over four floors. This brings the total number of stores trading by the year end to 191, from 5.9 million sq ft of selling space which is an increase of 9% since last year end.
Our stores in continental Europe performed well although it is still early days for Germany and Portugal. Plans are in place to open 11 new stores in the coming year, including our first store in Belgium, and there is a good pipeline of further stores.
As Primark has grown, its record on ethical trading, in common with all clothing retailers, has been subject to close scrutiny. It offers good quality fashion at low prices because it purchases very large volumes and has low mark-ups, minimal advertising and low overheads. Primark's success is also a result of its ability to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace with its flat management structure, a strong buying team and an excellent distribution capability. More than 95% of its third-party suppliers are shared with other leading European high street brands.
Sourcing from developing countries carries with it an obligation to ensure that workers making garments are treated fairly. Primark takes this responsibility seriously and has contributed to the industry-wide efforts to improve labour standards.
Primark has committed to undertake over 1,000 audits in 2009, nearly doubling the number achieved last year. A new Ethical Trade Director has been appointed along with a number of other appointments based in the main regions from which we source. Relationships with non-government organisations have been strengthened, especially in China, India and Bangladesh. Projects relating to the determination of a living wage, women's rights and home-working are under way.

Value retailing has grown enormously over the past decade. Verdict Research estimates that value clothing retailers have increased their market share from 11% in 1998 to 25% in 2008. Primark has been in the vanguard of this trend to the extent that some commentators predict a long-term shift in consumer behaviour towards value, which they have dubbed, the ‘Primark Effect'.
</p>
<p id="page15p9" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
From its foundation in Ireland in 1969, Primark established a winning formula using a retail model based on highly competitive pricing and fast-changing fashion-conscious product lines. Throughout its development it has demonstrated tenacious adherence to these principles while displaying considerable agility in adapting to changes in both the market environment and consumer behaviour.
</p>
<p id="page15p10" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
The last two decades have been the era of ‘fast fashion' during which catwalk-looks and celebrity creations have been converted at ever-increasing speed into affordable purchases for everyone.
</p>
<p id="page15p11" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
This has been fuelled by growth in the numbers and purchasing power of middle income groups and in particular by a new affluence amongst the young who enjoy expressing themselves through fashion, music and leisure. High fashion turnover has spurred frequency of shopping trips and higher than industry average sales per square foot. Moreover it has driven the footfall necessary to generate volume purchase in other categories within the stores such as footwear, lingerie and homeware.
</p>
<p id="page15p12" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Primark over this period has enjoyed a consistently growing share of a growing sector. But there has been another dynamic which has driven the remarkable growth of the business. Since 2001, Primark has grown its selling footprint from 1.7m sq ft to 5.9m sq ft. A significant feature of this growth has been the increase in average store size over that period from 16,000 sq ft to 30,000 sq ft.
</p>
<p id="page15p13" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Compared to the 1990s, new stores tend to be bigger than the average (the Manchester flagship store was extended to 136,000 sq ft last year). The high profile of the 70,000 sq ft
Oxford Street store has helped affirm the brand as a leading value retailer in the UK.
To achieve this transformation, ABF has invested over £1bn on new stores, extensions to existing stores and new fit-outs since 2005. As a result, Primark has transformed itself from its origins as a low price-point, tertiary-located clothing retailer into a leading value retailer in the UK.
</p>
<p id="page15p14" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Although competition and change in consumption patterns are potential competitive threats, Primark has consistently shown superior growth to the clothing category overall.
</p>
<p id="page15p15" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
It would seem for an ever-growing army of satisfied, fashion-conscious customers, Primark has indeed become a part of everyday life.

</p>
<p id="page17p9" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
In the US and Mexico, profitability at ACH was heavily impacted in the first half by taking long positions in vegetable oil futures at values well above the current market after a period when vegetable oil prices had risen sharply. Volumes of Mazola and Capullo were lower than last year as a reaction to the consequentially higher consumer prices. The performance in the second half steadily improved with higher Mazola volumes, following its consumer price reductions, and the full utilisation of the oil futures. Difficult market conditions have hampered the recovery of Capullo in Mexico. Home baking products and spices had a good year. Good progress was made with the integration of the foodservice, speciality food ingredient and retail private-label bottled oils businesses in Stratas, the 50% joint venture formed with Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in October. The products produced at ACH's factories are being transferred on a phased basis to the low-cost facilities contributed by ADM to Stratas. Major cost savings will be realised when ACH's facilities are finally closed in spring 2010. Following the transfer of its commodity oils business to Stratas, ACH has rationalised its overhead and focused on improvements to its processes to support what is now a branded food business.
In Australia, revenue was well ahead of last year reflecting the recovery of higher input costs and a strong performance from milling. Profit was also ahead although margin pressure was a feature both in the baking and meat businesses. A number of new products were launched during the year. Following the closure of the Canberra and Orange bakeries, announced at the end of last year, the consolidation of baking in New South Wales was completed with the upgrade of the Newcastle bakery. New product launches and packaging formats were also used to develop the Don and KR Castlemaine brands following the combination of these meat businesses last year. Rationalisation is progressing to plan with the closure of the factory in Perth and the start of the construction of the new factory in Castlemaine.
The UK grocery businesses made further progress led by a strong performance from Allied Bakeries where sales improved through distribution gains, delivered on the back of stronger trading relationships. In June this year Kingsmill became the first UK bread brand to use the Carbon Trust's Carbon Reduction Label when it featured the label on its Great Everyday White, Tasty Wholemeal and 50/50 loaves. At the end of the year we launched the Little Big Loaf in response to consumer demand for a loaf with full-sized slices but fewer of them.

Early indications are that this unique offering has been well received by the market.
Following an increased focus on health and safety in its commercial fleet, which covers one million kilometres each week, the business was delighted to receive an award for its promotion of safe driving by its employees.
Twinings Ovaltine is a successful international business which benefited from the favourable translation of the results of its overseas operations into sterling. It also delivered good volume growth, particularly from Ovaltine, in its developing markets with strong growth in Asia and the newer markets of Nigeria and Brazil. Growth slowed in Twinings as volumes of its premium products were affected but there was high consumer demand for Everyday tea. In the UK, a new television and press campaign supporting Twinings speciality teas was introduced in May with encouraging results. The Twinings brand also performed well in Australia supported by a successfully executed marketing plan including television commercials.
On 2 November 2009 Twinings announced that it was entering a period of consultation with employees over a proposed reorganisation of its tea manufacturing footprint. The changes will ensure that manufacturing will be closer to its major customer markets, it will have the capacity to meet future growth demands and it will be lower cost and more efficient than the current configuration.
It is proposed to invest in high-speed, automated packaging equipment at Andover to produce high-volume products mainly destined for the UK market. The Chinese factory would be doubled in size and would concentrate on the US and Asia Pacific markets and a new factory to be built in Poland would specialise in rest-of-world markets. The factory in Newcastle would close. The programme would take over two years to complete. The charge for this reorganisation of some £19m, of which £8m is non-cash, would be included in the income statement for the 2009/10 financial year.
Silver Spoon experienced a highly competitive market but benefited from increased demand for home baking ingredients. This, combined with distribution gains, resulted in higher sales and market share across the Silver Spoon sugar and Allinson flour ranges. The Silver Spoon brand was extended into the growing cake making and decorating category with the launch of the Cakecraft range in June. Closure of the Newark packaging plant and transfer of operations to an expanded plant at Bury St. Edmunds is virtually complete.
This year we successfully integrated Jordans Cereals and Ryvita into a single business headquartered in Biggleswade, with common systems and processes.
This was achieved on time and on budget whilst maintaining a high level of service to customers. Ryvita continued to perform well with good year-on-year sales growth in its core crispbread business. Jordans' trading improved during the year, after a slow start, with growth achieved in most of its key branded lines. The Country Crisp range was rationalised and responded well to its relaunch with improved recipes and new packaging.
The ethnic foodservice sector in the UK continued to suffer from the effects of recession which impacted sales by Westmill Foods. Profit was lower than last year as a consequence but our main brands, Lucky Boat, Patak's, Green Dragon, Habib and Rajah continued to develop well. Rajah was relaunched in the summer to coincide with its participation in three regional UK cultural events celebrating Asian music, dance and food.
Last year AB World Foods successfully combined the Blue Dragon and Patak's businesses with the creation of a single supply chain and the commissioning of a new sauces factory in Poland for Blue Dragon. This year we have focused on delivering the benefits of this combination and achieved a strong sales performance.
Margin was impacted by adverse commodity and currency movements. The Blue
Dragon brand continued to grow driven by the success of its stir-fry and sweet chilli dipping sauces. The Patak's brand has undergone a major relaunch with new and improved recipes and a new television advertising campaign focusing on the Pathak family heritage. Meena's, a premium Indian sauce range launched in the UK a year ago, has quickly established itself with availability in all major supermarkets.

Five years is a short time when you are building up a business, but that is how long it has taken to grow our Yeast and Bakery Ingredients business from a small UK joint venture into the worldwide number two in the market.
</p>
<p id="page20p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
AB Mauri was formed in November 2004 as a new operating division. It was created by bringing together the yeast and bakery ingredients businesses which were acquired from Burns Philp, our existing bakery ingredient operations, and other more recent acquisitions. Consistent commitment and investment since, has seen AB Mauri consolidate its European operations and construct new factories in areas of strong market growth such as China.
</p>
<p id="page20p5" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
AB Mauri has its global headquarters in the UK and is organised into six geographic regions. It operates from more than 48 locations in 27 countries and from its humble beginnings now has a total sales turnover of over one billion US dollars.
</p>
<p id="page20p6" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
As well as its regional structure, there are two centrally managed Technology Groups.
The Global Technology Group, based in Sydney, Australia covers all aspects of yeast manufacturing and operations including strain development, engineering, fermentation technology, project and procurement management.
</p>
<p id="page20p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">

The yeast and bakery ingredients business of AB Mauri performed well, with good sales growth in all geographic regions. Particularly good progress was made in yeast in South America and in technical ingredients in the Americas, but with tough trading conditions experienced in India. Operating margins improved following price increases achieved early in the year and the benefit of capital investment in cost reduction projects at our newly acquired factory in Italy.
Capital investment continued apace with further progress made on the significant expansion of the Chinese yeast plant in Harbin which is due to open in 2010.
Working closely with the relevant local authorities we continued our programme to upgrade effluent treatment plants in South America, India, Vietnam, China and the UK which will improve the quality of waste water, ensuring compliance with ever-tightening regulatory standards. A major new Innovations Centre was opened in Bangalore in April to provide a regional focus on Bakery Ingredients throughout south and west Asia. We closed our small yeast facility in Ireland and transferred production to Hull in the UK. The sale of the former Gilde Bakery Ingredients business in Iberia and our manufacturing plant in Portugal was completed in June in accordance with the agreement reached with the EU Commission.
ABF Ingredients had a difficult year with lower sales volumes and pressure on margins as some commodity prices fell. Feed enzymes performed well with good growth generated from geographic expansion and new products. The expansion of enzymes capacity in Finland by some 30% was completed during the year.
This removes the previous capacity constraint allowing previously outsourced production to be brought in-house and provides much needed flexibility for further development of this fast-growing business. Construction of the new yeast extracts facility, adjacent to the Chinese yeast plant in Harbin, is due to complete in 2010.
When opened this will be a low-cost complement to our existing facility in Hamburg, Germany which is running at full capacity.
In the US, the cost of key raw materials including fatty acids, rice and palm oil, fell from the high levels experienced last year which, combined with a better approach to global sourcing, resulted in an improvement in profitability. Our speciality proteins business has focused on whey protein production at Juda, Wisconsin, and we closed the loss-making Norfolk, Nebraska milk protein facility.
To minimise the cost base and maximise sales and management efficiencies we have merged the whey protein business with our speciality extruded ingredients business based in Woodland, California.

Group performance
</p>
<p id="page22p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Group revenue increased by 12% to £9.3bn with substantial growth in every business segment. The food businesses benefited from the weakness of sterling, the flow-through of price increases from last year, acquisitions and some volume growth. There was continued strong trading from Primark. At constant currency, and excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals, revenue increased by 7%. Revenue from the US packaged oils business that was contributed to the Stratas joint venture has been included in disposed businesses. Since the disposal, the group's interest in the joint venture has been equity accounted with the result that sales revenues are not consolidated.
Adjusted operating profit increased by 8% to £720m. At constant currency, and excluding the benefit of acquisitions, it increased by 3% but this ignores the impact that sterling weakness had on import costs which, for a number of businesses, and Primark in particular, was a significant factor in second half margin compression. Under international accounting standards, inventory acquired with a business is stated at its fair value and typically profit is reduced when the sale subsequently takes place. For the Azucarera acquisition this resulted in an increase of £12m in inventory, from book value to fair value. This non-cash amount, which reduced profit in the year, has been added back in calculating adjusted operating profit.
</p>
<p id="page22p8" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Other items excluded in calculating adjusted operating profit are profits less losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment, amortisation of non-operating intangibles and any exceptional items.
A net loss of £65m arose on the sale and closure of businesses, in line with that reported at the half year. This primarily related to the contribution of the US packaged oils business to the Stratas joint venture, £37m of which related to the write-off of property, plant and equipment at the two redundant ACH factories.
Finance expense less finance income of £78m compared with a charge of £53m last year. This year-on-year increase resulted from the continued significant level of capital investment in organic growth opportunities, the acquisition of new businesses and the impact of the US private placement which is currently a more expensive source of finance than bank debt at prevailing interest rates. Other financial income of £13m was primarily net income from retirement benefit schemes, being the expected return on assets in the group's schemes less the charge on pension scheme liabilities. This compared with a net income of £21m last year.
Profit before tax fell from £527m to £495m. This included the impact of the loss on disposal of businesses this year and an £11m reduction, year-on-year, in profits less losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment. Last year's profit before tax included a charge of £46m for exceptionals. Adjusted to exclude these items, underlying profit before tax increased by 4% to £655m.
</p>
<p id="page22p9" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Taxation
</p>
<p id="page22p10" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
The tax charge of £112m included an underlying charge of £166m, at an effective tax rate of 25.3% on the adjusted profit before tax. This was higher than last year's 24.4% as a result of the mix of profits in different tax jurisdictions and last year's one-time benefit from tax credits related to our investment in Zambia.
The overall tax charge for the year benefited from a £25m (2008 - £21m) credit for tax relief on the amortisation of non-operating intangible assets and goodwill arising from asset acquisitions. A tax credit of £25m arose on the loss on the sale of businesses and fixed assets and the tax on the fair value inventory adjustment discussed above amounted to £4m.

Earnings and dividends
</p>
<p id="page22p12" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Earnings attributable to equity shareholders were £359m, £2m higher than last year, and the weighted average number of shares in issue used to calculate earnings per share fell from 790 million to 789 million. Earnings per ordinary share were 1% ahead of last year at 45.5p. Adjusted earnings per share which provides a more consistent measure of performance increased by 5% from 54.9p to 57.7p.
The interim dividend was increased by 2% to 6.9p and a final dividend has been proposed at 14.1p which represents an overall increase of 4% for the year.
In accordance with IFRS, no accrual has been made in these accounts for the proposed dividend which is expected to cost £111m and will be charged next year.
The dividend is covered 2.75 times on an adjusted basis.

Balance sheet
</p>
<p id="page23p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Non-current assets increased by £647m to £6,018m. Property, plant and equipment of £3,519m increased by £409m driven by acquisitions, which added £218m, and capital expenditure net of depreciation of £223m. Working capital increased by £65m primarily due to higher inventory values as a result of the Azucarera acquisition. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, working capital fell reflecting lower commodity costs and an increased focus on working capital management.
Net borrowings at the year end were £208m higher than last year at £999m.
A currency gain of £243m arose on the translation into sterling of the group's foreign currency denominated net assets. This resulted from the fact that sterling was weaker against all major currencies at the end of this year than at the end of the previous year. The group's net assets increased by £232m to £5,076m.
Return on capital employed for the group fell from 16.6% to 15.4%. This is largely a consequence of the substantial level of investment made this year in a number of long-term capital projects which have yet to yield a return. Return on capital employed is defined as adjusted operating profit expressed as a percentage of average capital employed for the year.
</p>
<p id="page23p5" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Cash flow
</p>
<p id="page23p6" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Net cash flow from operating activities was £833m compared with £553m last year. This substantial increase mainly reflects a strong working capital performance with an inflow of £117m compared with an outflow of £110m last year, despite the considerable growth in the business.
We continued to invest significantly in the future growth of the group with a net
£832m spent on property, plant and equipment, intangibles and acquisitions net of disposals during the year. Capital expenditure amounted to £545m of which £159m was spent on the acquisition and fit-out of Primark stores. Elsewhere expenditure was incurred on yeast and yeast extract production in China, the expansion of our sugar interests in southern Africa, bioethanol production in the UK and enzymes capacity in Finland. Compensation received for sugar quota renounced last year amounted to £101m.
We invested £391m on acquisitions, principally on the leading sugar producer in Iberia but also on an animal feed mill in the UK and a sugar cane farm in Zambia.
£145m was received from business disposals, primarily the Polish sugar business, the Pongola mill in South Africa and the former Gilde Bakery Ingredients business in Iberia which was sold, together with our manufacturing plant in Portugal, in accordance with an agreement reached with the EU Commission.

<p id="page23p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Financing
</p>
<p id="page23p8" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Cash and cash equivalents totalled £383m at the year end. These were managed during the year by a central treasury department, operating under strictly controlled guidelines, which also arranges term bank finance for acquisitions and to meet short-term working capital requirements, particularly for the sugar beet and wheat harvests.
</p>
<p id="page23p9" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
At the year end the group had total committed borrowing facilities amounting to £1,847m of which £1,007m was drawn down. £1,073m of these facilities expire in October 2011, with the remainder maturing from 2012 to 2021. The group also had access, at the year end, to £841m of uncommitted credit lines under which £358m was drawn. The significant increase in headroom on these facilities since last year is the consequence of the £320m bank facility which was secured at the beginning of the year, and the US$610m raised in March through a private placement in the US which strengthened the group balance sheet and secured long-term non-bank financing.
</p>
<p id="page23p10" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Pensions
</p>
<p id="page23p11" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Pensions are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 - Employee benefits.
The total pension expense for the year was £69m compared with £62m last year.
On an IAS 19 basis, liabilities in the group's defined benefit pension schemes now exceed employee benefit assets by £106m compared with last year's surplus of £61m. This turnaround is the consequence of a fall in asset values as equity and bond markets have responded to the worldwide recession together with inflationary increases in scheme liabilities. The triennial actuarial valuation of the UK Pension Scheme undertaken in 2008 revealed a funding deficit of £163m which, by agreement with the Trustees, the Company will eliminate with five deficit payments of £30m each, the first of which was made in March 2009.
Total contributions to defined benefit plans in the year amounted to £75m
(2008 - £54m).
For defined contribution schemes the charge for the year is equal to the contributions made which amounted to £33m (2008 - £26m).

On 2 November 2009, Twinings announced that it was entering a period of consultation with employees over a proposed reorganisation of its tea manufacturing operations. The charge for this reorganisation is expected to be £19m and will be included in the income statement for the financial year 2009/10.

<p id="page24p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Our approach to corporate responsibility is based on the group's core values - taking care of our people, managing our environmental impacts, being good neighbours and fostering ethical business relationships. Because the organisational structure of the group is highly decentralised, responsibility for managing environmental, social and ethical issues day-to-day rests with the management of each operating business.
As a minimum, however, all businesses must comply with our Business Principles, which can be found online at www.abf.co.uk. These Business Principles include the group's Health and Safety and Environmental Policies for which the Group Human
Resources Director has overall responsibility. He reports to the Chief Executive and is supported directly by a Group Safety &amp; Environment Manager who also works with the Director of Legal Services on these principles and compliance issues.
Our businesses devise procedures appropriate to and compliant with local laws, cultures and operating conditions. Every business has an accountable board director and a senior manager who are responsible for safety and environmental matters.
The board reviews our safety and environmental performance annually as well as reviewing the outcome of the external assurance processes. The Group Human
Resources Director receives a monthly briefing and the Chief Executive receives briefings quarterly, based on performance monitoring data. The board assesses the sophistication of each business' risk management and safety cultures, considers levels of resources and agrees actions for the coming year.

We have always had a clear policy of meeting the relevant legal safety standards in every country in which we operate and we use the national standards as a minimum. During 2009 we invested over £22m in upgrading plant and equipment to improve our safety. The businesses use risk control procedures and training to prevent injury at work and 27 sites have been independently certified as meeting OHSAS 18001 safety management systems or equivalent.
</p>
<p id="page24p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
We very much regret that there were nine deaths at work during the year. Three of these fatalities were contractors working on major factory expansion projects in AB Mauri, Bo Tian in northern China and Illovo Sugar in Africa. We have placed great emphasis on the management of contractors and on construction safety standards. The six employee deaths occurred at AB Agri and Bo Tian in northern China, ACH in America and three in Illovo Sugar, Africa. Each had a different immediate cause. We carried out a detailed investigation into all of the accidents, put stronger controls in place to prevent a recurrence and communicated these across the Company.
We are pleased to report that in 2009, 114 factories and 129 Primark stores achieved a year's operation without any reportable injuries and since 2006 our overall rate of reportable injuries has reduced by 65%.
Despite this good progress, we fully recognise that further improvement is achievable. For all our manufacturing and retail operations, the working environment and physical safety standards such as machinery guarding, electrical safety and control of hazardous substances, are carefully monitored and upgraded using guidance published by national regulatory authorities as a benchmark. We place special focus on construction safety and reducing the risks from moving vehicles. Our businesses have continued to develop the breadth and depth of their risk-management systems, which include clear objectives and personal safety improvement targets, effective physical controls and management procedures and routine performance monitoring. The Group Human Resources
Director together with the Group Safety &amp; Environment Manager reviewed the safety improvement action plans of the operating companies to ensure that they address the principal risks and have agreed their safety priorities for the coming year.
We place a high value on the efficient use of natural resources, the minimisation of impact from our operations on the communities and physical environments in which we operate and on legal compliance. The principal environmental impacts from our operations are energy usage and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide, the abstraction of water, the treatment and disposal of waste water and the generation and disposal of waste.
During 2009 we invested over £47m in upgrading our environmental controls.
Thirty-two of our sites have been externally certified to ISO 14001 or equivalent for their environmental risk management systems.
Efficient use of energy is central to the way we work as it not only reduces our use of natural resources it reduces our operating costs. In 2009 our established factories used a total of 25.4 Terawatt hours of energy, an almost identical amount as in 2008 despite the growth of the business. Our sugar factories, which account for 85% of the Company's total energy usage, reduced their energy consumption by 3%.
As a result of the energy usage, we emitted, or caused to be emitted, 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in our established factories, a similar amount to 2008.
We are pleased to report that half of our energy comes from renewable energy sources, mainly fibre (bagasse) from the processing of sugar cane, which prevents us having to burn fossil fuels.
We also target the efficient use of water. The two major water users are the sugar and yeast processes. Compared with last year our established factories have been able to reduce the amount of water entering our factories by 17 million tonnes, although water usage is affected by climatic conditions and rainfall patterns and so cannot be guaranteed each year.
We aim to minimise waste and its associated financial penalties and to maximise operational efficiency. The waste that we generate is properly handled and disposed of. We seek opportunities to use the intrinsic value in the waste and to recycle.
In 2009 our UK operations recycled 50,000 tonnes of packaging, mostly paper and plastic.

Our approach to corporate responsibility is based on the group's core values.

<div id="page25" class="page">
<p id="page25p1" lang="en" fontname="GGICKE+FSAlbert-ExtraBold">
Across the group we use our knowledge and expertise to help tackle climate change. Measuring carbon footprints - the impact of human activities on the environment in terms of units of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases - is a particular focus. It is a powerful tool enabling farmers and producers, retailers and consumers to make more informed choices.
</p>
<p id="page25p2" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
AB Agri is a pioneer in the development of sustainable agricultural practices.
It has developed the world's first carbon footprinting model for dairy farms.
This enables farmers to measure the environmental impact of individual feeds and rations on their dairy herds - which are responsible throughout the UK for producing about 10% of all greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide).
</p>
<p id="page25p3" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
This model was developed using the Carbon Trust's PAS 2050 methodology for measuring embedded greenhouse gas emissions and can be applied to other livestock sectors such as meat, poultry and egg production. Major retailers are already embracing the development: for example, Sainsbury's recorded a reduction of 5,000 tonnes of CO 2 over 12 months during a trial involving 325 farms.
</p>
<p id="page25p4" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
British Sugar and our Silver Spoon brand were pilot partners with the Carbon Trust in developing the PAS 2050 standard.
Silver Spoon used it to analyse the carbon footprint of its homegrown granulated sugar, completing a detailed assessment at each stage of production from growing and transporting the sugar beet to refining and delivering to store.
</p>
<p id="page25p5" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Now, anyone buying a 1kg bag of Silver Spoon granulated sugar knows that it generated 0.5kg of carbon - a significantly reduced footprint thanks to the company's many years of focusing on energy efficiency.
</p>
<p id="page25p6" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Kingsmill is the first bread manufacturer in the UK licensed to use the Carbon Trust's carbon reduction label. It is now carried on Kingsmill's three best-selling loaves, showing the carbon footprint of each and demonstrating the brand's commitment to reducing these over the next two years.
</p>
<p id="page25p7" lang="en" fontname="GGICHB+FSAlbert-Light">
Meanwhile, the carbon footprints of our TOPSOIL and LimeX products, used as soil improvers in agriculture and by the landscape and amenity industries, are also now certified according to PAS 2050.
TOPSOIL produces 9kg of CO 2 per tonne of product and LimeX 2kg per tonne.

The board remains committed to the principles of good corporate governance and to maintaining high standards of business ethics and professionalism across the group, which it believes are vital to the Company's business integrity and successful long-term performance. The board recognises that corporate governance is not an end in itself but an important means to an end.
The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require UK listed companies to report on the manner in which they apply the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the ‘Combined Code') which is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk
The board recognises that the Combined Code represents best practice and this report, together with the Remuneration report, sets out how the Company applies the principles of this Combined Code which deal with directors, directors' remuneration, relations with, and accountability to, shareholders, and the audit

of the Company. The board will also continue to keep developments in the Combined Code, including the current consultation being conducted by the Financial Reporting Council, under review and will in due course consider how best to address any such developments.

A.4.4. - The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors should be made available for inspection
Galen Weston has not entered into a formal letter of appointment.
This is due to his relationship with the Company's ultimate holding company, Wittington Investments
Limited of which he is a director and shareholder.
Galen Weston receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role. In accordance with the Combined Code, he is subject to annual re-election.

Charles Sinclair is both Chairman and chairman of the Remuneration committee.
The board of Associated British Foods plc does not accept this recommendation as it considers that Charles Sinclair, due to his experience, is best suited to chair this committee. The Combined Code now recognises that the Chairman can be a member of the Remuneration committee. No director has any involvement in the determination of his own remuneration.

All members of the board take collective responsibility for the overall management and performance of the Company. The board met formally nine times during the year. The individual attendance by directors is detailed on page 32.
Whilst the board has delegated day-to-day management of the Company to the Chief Executive, there is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the board for decision, through which the board oversees control of the Company's affairs.
This schedule of matters reserved includes the approval of:
• annual and interim results and interim management statements;
• the Company's strategic and operating plans;
• the annual budget;
• appointments to the board and as Company Secretary;
• treasury policies;
• dividend recommendation;
• the issue of new shares;
• amendments to the Company's pension scheme;
• larger capital expenditure, acquisitions, disposals and investment proposals; and
• the overall system of internal control and risk management.
Certain specific responsibilities are delegated to the board committees, notably the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination committees, which operate within clearly defined terms of reference, reporting regularly to the board.

<p id="page29p6" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Composition
</p>
<p id="page29p7" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The board currently comprises the Chairman Charles Sinclair, the Chief Executive
George Weston, the Finance Director John Bason and four non-executive directors who are independent of management and have no relationships which would materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The board also includes Galen Weston, a non-executive director, who is not regarded as independent in view of his relationship with Wittington Investments Limited.
Following the retirement of Martin Adamson in April 2009, Charles Sinclair was appointed Chairman. On his appointment as Chairman, Charles Sinclair met the independence criteria set out in the Combined Code.
The board considers that the non-executive directors provide a solid foundation for good corporate governance for the group and ensure that no individual or group dominates the board's decision-making. Collectively, the non-executive directors bring a wide range of international experience and expertise to the board. They each occupy or have occupied senior positions in industry or public life and consequently contribute significantly to board decision-making.
Details of the full board are set out on pages 28 and 29.

The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separately held and the division of their responsibilities is clearly established, set out in writing, and agreed by the board. The Chairman, Charles Sinclair, is responsible for the running and leadership of the board. The Chief Executive, George Weston, is responsible for leading and managing the business within the authorities delegated by the board.

Under the Articles, both now and as they are proposed to be amended at the forthcoming annual general meeting, all directors seek election at their first annual general meeting following appointment. The Articles also require all directors who held office at the time of the two preceding annual general meetings, and in any event not less than one third of the directors, to submit themselves for re-election.
In accordance with the Combined Code, all non-executive directors who have served for more than nine years must also submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis. Accordingly, Galen Weston, Lord Jay, Javier Ferrán and Tim Clarke will be required to seek re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

On joining the board, directors are given background documents describing the Company and its activities and are provided with an appropriate induction programme. The Company offers major shareholders the opportunity to meet new non-executive directors. Site visits were arranged during the year for Charles Sinclair to meet the senior management teams at major business units. Ongoing training is provided as necessary.

Board and committee papers are circulated to members in advance of the meetings. The Company Secretary manages the provision of information to the board at other appropriate times, in consultation with the Chairman and Chief Executive. In addition to formal meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive maintain regular contact with all directors. The Chairman also holds informal meetings with non-executive directors, without any of the executives being present, to discuss any issues affecting the group.
In order to keep the non-executive directors informed of events throughout the group between board meetings, regular management updates are sent to each director. This seeks to ensure that the non-executive directors are always kept fully informed of the latest issues affecting the group.

Accountability and audit
</p>
<p id="page31p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The board is required by the Combined Code to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's position and prospects.
In relation to this requirement, reference is made to the statement of directors'
responsibilities for preparing the financial statements set out on page 52 of this annual report and accounts.
The independent auditors' report on page 53 includes a statement by the auditors about their reporting responsibilities. The board recognises that its responsibility to present a balanced and understandable assessment extends to interim and other price-sensitive public reports, reports to regulators and information required to be presented by law.

Going concern
</p>
<p id="page31p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business review on pages 2 to 25. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial review on pages 24 and 25.
In addition, the risk management review on pages 38 to 41 and note 25 on pages 90 to 102 provide details of the group's policy on managing its financial and commodity risks.
The group has considerable financial resources, good access to debt markets, a diverse range of businesses and a wide geographic spread. It is therefore well placed to manage business risks successfully despite the current economic uncertainty.
After making enquiries the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.

Procedures to deal with directors' conflicts of interest
</p>
<p id="page31p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The Company has procedures in place to deal with the situation where a director has a conflict of interest. As part of this process, the members of the board endeavour to:
• consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts;
• consider the conflict situation in conjunction with the rest of his duties under the Companies Act 2006;
• keep records and board minutes as to authorisations granted by directors and the scope of any approvals given; and
• regularly review conflict authorisation.
The Company has complied with these procedures during the year.

Board evaluation
</p>
<p id="page31p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
During the year, the board commissioned Egon Zehnder to carry out an independent evaluation of its performance. The review was conducted by way of a detailed questionnaire completed by each of the directors and the Company
Secretary, followed by one-to-one interviews between each individual and the external consultant.
The review produced areas for consideration, in particular how the board could improve its deliberations. The issues identified have been discussed and changes to board practice implemented as appropriate. Overall, the evaluation process in 2009 confirmed that the board and its principal committees had functioned efficiently during the year and that all the directors continue to contribute effectively and with proper commitment to their roles, including of time.

Relations with shareholders
</p>
<p id="page31p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The Company is committed to increasing shareholder value and communicates its achievements and prospects to its shareholders in an accurate and timely manner. Apart from the annual general meeting, the Company communicates with its shareholders by way of the annual report and accounts and the interim report. Significant matters relating to the trading or development of the business are disseminated to the market by way of Stock Exchange announcements and by press release and appear on the Company's website. The Company also holds meetings with its major institutional shareholders to discuss the Company's operations.
The senior independent director is available to shareholders in the event that communication with the Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance Director has failed to resolve concerns or where such contact is inappropriate.
The annual general meeting takes place in London. Formal notification is sent to shareholders approximately one month in advance and in any event at least 21 days before the meeting. Other general meetings may also be convened from time to time on at least 21 days' notice or where certain requirements are met including prior approval by shareholders by way of special resolution, on 14 days' notice. The annual general meeting gives shareholders an opportunity to hear about the general development of the business and to ask questions of the Chairman and, through him, the chairmen of the key committees and other directors. The practice has been for a short film to be shown at the meeting explaining a particular area of the group's business. Details of the meeting and the resolutions to be proposed together with explanatory notes are set out in the Notice of Meeting which is sent to shareholders. Any member attending the AGM has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting, except in certain circumstances including if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting to do so or if to do so would involve the disclosure of confidential information. Shareholders attending the meeting are advised of the number of proxy votes lodged for each resolution. All resolutions are voted on by poll and the results announced to the London Stock Exchange and posted on the Company's website.

The Audit committee is responsible for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the group's external auditors and for reviewing the Company's internal audit resources, internal financial controls and the audit process. It aids the board in seeking to ensure that the financial and non-financial information supplied to shareholders presents a balanced assessment of the Company's position.
The Audit committee reviews the objectivity and independence of the external auditors and also considers the scope of their work and fees paid for audit and non-audit services.
The Audit committee has unrestricted access to Company documents and information, as well as to employees of the Company and the external auditors.
Members of the committee may, in pursuit of their duties, take independent professional advice on any matter at the Company's expense. The committee chairman reports the outcome of meetings to the board.

Duties
</p>
<p id="page32p18" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The Nomination committee is responsible for identifying and nominating, for the approval of the board, candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise. Before an appointment is made, the committee evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the board and, in the light of this evaluation, prepares a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.
Candidates from a wide range of backgrounds are considered. The Nomination committee normally uses external advisors to facilitate searches for potential candidates.
The time required from a non-executive director is reviewed annually. The annual board evaluation is used to assess whether the non-executive director is spending sufficient time to fulfil his duties.
The Nomination committee gives full consideration to succession planning in the course of its work, taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the Company and what skills and expertise are therefore needed on the board and from senior management in the future.

During the year, the Audit committee formally reviewed draft interim and annual reports and associated announcements. These reviews considered:
• the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the group's financial statements and proposed changes to them;
• the integrity of the financial statements, including a review of important accounting issues, areas of complexity and significant financial reporting judgements;
• litigation and contingent liabilities affecting the group; and
• potential tax contingencies and the group's compliance with statutory tax obligations.
The Audit committee is required to assist the board to fulfil its responsibilities relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of the control environment, controls over financial reporting and the group's compliance with the Combined Code.
To fulfil these duties, the committee reviewed:
• the external auditors' management letters and audit highlights memoranda;
• internal audit reports on key audit areas and significant deficiencies in the financial control environment;
• reports on the systems of internal financial controls and risk management; and
• reports on frauds perpetrated against the group.
The Audit committee is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of policies and procedures on the use of the auditor for non-audit services, in accordance with professional and regulatory requirements. These policies are kept under review to meet the objective of ensuring that the group benefits in a cost-effective manner from the cumulative knowledge and experience of its auditor whilst also ensuring that the auditor maintains the necessary degree of independence and objectivity. Consequently, any non-audit work to be undertaken by the auditor in excess of £300,000 is required to be authorised by the chairman of the Audit committee and the Group Finance Director prior to its commencement. Individual assignments less than £300,000 are approved by the Group Finance Director.
The Audit committee has formally reviewed the independence of its auditors.
KPMG Audit Plc have provided a letter confirming that they believe they remain independent within the meaning of the regulations on this matter and their professional standards.
</p>
<p id="page33p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Membership of the Audit committee is determined by the board, on the recommendation of the Nomination committee and in consultation with the committee chairman, from amongst the independent, non-executive directors of the Company. Its terms of reference are set by the board and are modelled closely on the provisions of the Combined Code.
Appointments are for a period of three years after which they are subject to annual review, extendable by additional three year periods so long as members continue to be independent. The Audit committee is comprised of a minimum of three independent non-executive directors at any time. Two members constitute a quorum.
The Audit committee structure requires the inclusion of one financially qualified member (as recognised by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies).
Currently the committee chairman fulfils this requirement. All committee members are expected to be financially literate.
The board expects Audit committee members to have an understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, and developments in, financial reporting including the applicable accounting standards and statements of recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Company's operations including corporate policies and the group's internal control environment;
• matters which may influence the presentation of accounts and key figures;
• the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external auditing and risk management; and
• the regulatory framework for the group's businesses.

<p id="page34p5" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The Audit committee is required to assist the board to fulfil its responsibilities relating to the adequacy of the resourcing and plans of internal audit. To fulfil these duties, the committee reviewed:
• internal audit's terms of reference, reporting lines and access to the committee and all members of the board;
• internal audit's plans and its achievement of the planned activity;
• the results of key audits and other significant findings, the adequacy of management's response and the timeliness of resolution;
• statistics on staff numbers, qualifications and experience and timeliness of reporting;
• the level and nature of non-audit activity performed by internal audit; and
• changes since the last annual assessment in the nature and extent of significant financial risks and the group's ability to respond to changes in its business and the external environment.
The group's ‘whistle-blowing' policy contains arrangements for the Company
Secretary to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal controls, auditing issues and related matters for reporting to the Audit committee as appropriate.
The group's anti-fraud policy has been communicated to all employees and states that all employees have a responsibility for fraud prevention and detection. Any suspicion of fraud should be reported immediately and will be investigated vigorously.
The Audit committee holds private meetings with the external auditors after each committee meeting to review key issues within their sphere of interest and responsibility.
The chairman of the Audit committee will be present at the annual general meeting to answer questions on this report, matters within the scope of the committee's responsibilities and any significant matters brought to the committee's attention by the external auditors.
The full terms of reference of the Audit committee are available on the Company's website: www.abf.co.uk
</p>
<p id="page34p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external auditors, the Audit committee reviewed:
• changes in external audit executives in the audit plan for the current year;
• a report from the external auditors describing their arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; and
• the extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the committee reviewed:
• the external auditors' fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and variations from it; and
• reports highlighting the major issues that arose during the course of the audit.
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight of the external audit process, the Audit committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties and scope of the audit as set out in the external auditors' engagement letter for the forthcoming year;
• the external auditors' overall work plan for the forthcoming year;
• the external auditors' fee proposal;
• the major issues that arose during the course of the audit and their resolution;
• key accounting and audit judgements;
• the levels of errors identified during the audit; and
• recommendations made by the external auditors in their management letters and the adequacy of management's response.
Having satisfied itself that the external auditors remain independent, the Audit committee has recommended to the board that KPMG Audit Plc be reappointed.

Internal audit
</p>
<p id="page35p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group's businesses employ internal auditors (both employees and resources provided by Ernst &amp; Young where appropriate) with skills and experience relevant to the operation of each business. All of the internal audit activities are co-ordinated centrally by the group's Director of Financial Control, who is accountable to the Audit committee.
All group businesses are required to comply with the group's financial control framework that sets out minimum control standards. A key function of the group's internal audit resources is to undertake audits to ensure compliance with the financial control framework and make recommendations for improvement in controls where appropriate. Internal audit also conducts regular reviews to ensure that risk management procedures and controls are observed. The Audit committee receives regular reports on the results of internal audit's work and monitors the status of recommendations arising. The committee reviews annually the adequacy, qualifications and experience of the group's internal audit resources and the nature and scope of internal audit activity in the overall context of the group's risk management system set out below. The Director of Financial Control meets with the chairman of the committee as appropriate but at least annually, without the presence of executive management, and has direct access to the Chairman of the board.

Financial reporting
</p>
<p id="page35p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Detailed management accounts are prepared every four weeks, consolidated in a single system and reviewed by senior management and the board. They include a comprehensive set of financial reports and key performance indicators covering commercial, operational, environmental and people issues. Performance against budgets and forecasts is discussed regularly at board meetings and at meetings between operational and group management. The adequacy and suitability of key performance indicators is reviewed regularly. All chief executives and finance directors of the group's operations are asked to sign an annual confirmation that their business has complied with the Group Accounting Manual and specifically to confirm the adequacy and accuracy of accounting provisions.

Internal control
</p>
<p id="page35p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The board acknowledges its responsibilities for the group's system of internal control to facilitate the identification, assessment and management of risk, the protection of shareholders' investments and the group's assets. The directors recognise that they are responsible for providing a return to shareholders, which is consistent with the responsible assessment and mitigation of risks.
Effective controls ensure that the group is not exposed to avoidable risk, that proper accounting records have been maintained, that the financial information used within the business is reliable and that the consolidated accounts preparation and financial reporting processes comply with all relevant regulatory reporting requirements. The dynamics of the group and the environment within which it operates are continually evolving together with its exposure to risk. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of assets being unprotected and to guard against their unauthorised use and the failure to achieve business objectives. Internal controls can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The directors confirm that there is a continuing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the group and the operational effectiveness of the related controls, which has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. They also confirm that they have regularly reviewed the system of internal controls utilising the review process set out below.

Standards

There are guidelines on the minimum group-wide requirements for health and safety and environmental standards. There are also guidelines on the minimum level of internal control that each of the divisions should exercise over specified processes. Each business has developed and documented policies and procedures to comply with the minimum control standards established, including procedures for monitoring compliance and taking corrective action. The board of each business is required to confirm bi-annually that it has complied with these policies and procedures.

High-level controls
</p>
<p id="page35p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
All operations prepare annual operating plans and budgets which are updated regularly. Performance against budget is monitored at operational level and centrally, with variances being reported promptly. The cash position at group and operational level is monitored constantly and variances from expected levels are investigated thoroughly.
Clearly defined guidelines have been established for capital expenditure and investment decisions. These include the preparation of budgets, appraisal and review procedures and delegated authority levels.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The group's risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of the key risks facing the businesses at an operational level and to operate internal controls to mitigate these risks. The key risks and internal control procedures are reviewed by group personnel together with internal audit activities. Each business is responsible for regularly assessing its risk management activities to ensure good practice in all areas. Compliance with group requirements is monitored six monthly, and these assessments are formally reviewed by group personnel at least annually. The board reviews annually the risk management process and its implementation in each of the businesses. A review of the main risks facing the group is embedded within every board agenda and summarised on an annual basis. The Audit committee receives reports on internal financial control issues both from management and the external auditors and regularly reports to the board for the purposes of the board's annual review.
The principal corporate risks as identified by each business and reviewed by the board are currently:

Our businesses have a positive role to play in contributing to the quality of people's lives by providing wholesome and nutritious foods, food ingredients and animal feedstuffs. Sugar, tea, flour, bread, cereals and meat products are part of people's daily lives all over the world and every effort is made to ensure these are produced efficiently and to a high quality.
To manage food safety risks, manufacturing sites operate food safety systems which are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain effective, including compliance with all regulatory requirements for hygiene and food safety. Food products are made to high standards regardless of where they are manufactured and food safety is put before economic considerations.

Global economic slowdown and changing consumer demand
</p>
<p id="page36p9" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The economic slowdown and turmoil in the global economy has adversely impacted consumer markets, including those in which we operate. Our businesses are dependent on continued consumer demand for their products, and reduced consumer wealth may result in consumers becoming unwilling or unable to purchase our products, with clear implications for turnover and profitability.
Our strategy is aimed at delivering value to consumers, through strong brands, supported by differentiated innovation and continued product improvement.
We seek to build mutually rewarding relationships with customers in order to make our products available across all relevant channels.
</p>
<p id="page36p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
We have a significant number of global brands and any adverse event affecting consumer confidence or continuity of supply of such a brand could have an adverse impact in many of our markets, or in some cases affect intangible asset values.
We support our brands and their growth through competitive levels of investment in advertising and promotions. The breadth of the business portfolio and our geographic reach also help to mitigate general economic risks. We aim to protect the value of our brands through research and development, product quality and by operating in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
These measures are aimed at extending our consumer offerings, reducing the impact of falling consumer demand or of consumers switching to alternative products, thus allowing us to compete effectively in our key categories and countries.

Input costs, supplier and supply chain reliance
</p>
<p id="page36p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Primark's ethical trade programme has been strengthened considerably over the past year. In March, Primark appointed its first Ethical Trade Director and in the last 12 months it has doubled the size of its in-house ethical trade team around the world. Primark is visiting and working with more suppliers than ever before.
It will audit more than 1,000 factories in 2009, up from 533 last year. An important and growing area of team activity is training, both internally and externally. In the first half of 2009 Primark's buyers and key personnel received over 1,500 hours of ethical trade training, as part of a continuous programme to help them understand the impact of their actions further down the supply chain and improve their purchasing practices. Primark is concentrating on developing the support it gives to suppliers to meet its code of conduct and held supplier training sessions in India and the UK. Plans are under way for others in China, Bangladesh and Turkey to be held by the end of 2009. In addition to a new supplier management system which will help with monitoring and remediation, a suppliers' extranet, including many practical tools to improve compliance, is due to be launched by the end of 2009.
Primark is engaging with local experts, including unions and Non-Government
Organisations (NGOs), in many of the regions from which it sources. It has built solid partnerships with a number of NGOs, such as a grassroots project with SAVE in India, to understand and address the challenges faced by workers in the communities where its products are made, and in Bangladesh a project with Nari Uddug Kendra, particularly focusing on training workers on their entitlements, including wages and associated rights. Two projects on living wages, one in Bangladesh and one in China, are under way with the aim of creating long-term improvements in labour standards. Primark is an active member of the Ethical
Trading Initiative and participates in a number of working groups including the General Merchandisers, Homeworking, Purchasing Practices, Reporting and China Forum. Primark launched a dedicated ethical trade section on its website in May which provides information and updates on its programme.

Profitable manufacturing is dependent on obtaining adequate supplies of production materials in a timely and cost-effective manner. Prices are significantly influenced by global economic conditions and can fluctuate, which may have an impact on margins and cash flows.
We are also dependent on suppliers and global supply chains as a means of producing and supplying our products. As a result we are exposed to business interruption from natural disasters or catastrophes and through additional risks of changes in local legal and regulatory schemes, labour shortages and disruptions from environmental and industrial incidents.
In the current climate we also face a risk that our suppliers may fail to meet their contractual obligations. Active monitoring of suppliers and the supply chain is in place, and regular supplier counterparty risk analysis is undertaken to mitigate this risk.
We actively monitor our external environment, review and revisit our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and continue to adapt our internal cost structures to deliver products at competitive prices.

The penalties for failing to comply with the 1998 Competition Act, the 2003

Environment
</p>
<p id="page37p7" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
We recognise the impact that our businesses have on the environment. Therefore, as a minimum, we comply with current applicable legislation of the countries in which we operate and our operations are conducted with a view to ensuring that:
• emissions to air, releases to water and landfilling of solid wastes do not cause unacceptable environmental impacts and do not offend the community;
• significant plant and process changes are assessed and positively authorised in advance to prevent adverse environmental impacts;
• energy is used efficiently and consumption is monitored;
• natural resources are used efficiently;
• raw material waste is minimised;
• solid waste is reduced, reused or recycled where practicable;
• the amount of packaging used for our products is minimised, consistent with requirements for food safety and product protection;
</p>
<p id="page37p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
• products are transported efficiently to minimise fuel usage, consistent with customers' demands, production arrangements and vehicle fleet operations;
• accidents are prevented so far as is reasonably practical; and
• effective emergency response procedures are in place to minimise the impact of foreseeable incidents.
Particular attention is paid to recently acquired businesses to ensure they operate in accordance with the standards we expect of the group's businesses.
The principal environmental risk is the use of energy and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas involved in climate change. The efficient use of energy is a major element of our environmental policy. Indeed, all sites which are subject to the EU's Pollution Prevention and Control regime are also under a statutory requirement to minimise energy consumption by use of best available techniques.
Our manufacturing operations in the UK participate in the UK Government's
Climate Change Agreement Scheme in which energy-intensive businesses receive an 80% discount from the Climate Change Levy in return for meeting energy-efficiency or carbon-saving targets. The sugar sites in the UK and Poland participate in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. These schemes encourage the sites to reduce energy consumption and therefore reduce emissions of carbon dioxide cost-effectively.
In addition to the consumption of energy we generate surplus electricity from highly efficient Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants and sell this electricity to other companies. All UK CHP plants participate in the UK Government's
CHP quality assurance scheme and qualify for a full exemption from the UK's
Climate Change Levy.
Carbon dioxide is emitted directly from the combustion of fossil fuels to create steam, heat and electricity at our factories, and indirectly by the power stations from which we buy our electricity. The use of bagasse (sugar cane fibre, which is a renewable resource and hence carbon neutral) as a fuel in the cane factories eliminates the need to use coal and other fossil fuels to provide energy to our boilers.
Other significant environmental risks include the handling and disposal of waste and the treatment of waste water. The principal legal risk is regulatory action for non-compliance with licence conditions and statutory requirements.
All of our businesses have named senior executives and responsible managers accountable for waste, and the management of the physical and legal risks, for which they employ specialists, is included in their annual objectives.

We are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace in line with local regulations to protect all employees, visitors and the public insofar as they come into contact with foreseeable work hazards. We consider health and safety to be no less important than any other function. We require our businesses to build a culture of sustained improvement.
People's health and safety at work is a prime responsibility for all those who manage and supervise. All employees and those working on behalf of the Company have a responsibility for the health and safety of themselves and others who may be affected by their actions. We ensure that they are well informed, appropriately trained and are consulted on matters affecting their health and safety.
The principal health and safety risks relate to the potential for serious injuries, fatal accidents and regulatory action for non-compliance with statutory requirements.
As with environmental risks, all the group's businesses have named accountable senior executives who employ specialists to manage these risks, which form part of their annual objectives.

Financial and commodity risks
</p>
<p id="page38p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the group's financial and commodity risks. Financial risks essentially arise through exposure to foreign currencies, interest rates, counterparty credit and borrowings. Commodity risks arise from the procurement of raw materials and the exposure to changes in market prices. Liquidity risk arises from the availability of internal and external funding to enable the group to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.
Sufficient funding is maintained by way of external loans and committed bank facilities to meet our expected needs. An extended period of constraint in the capital markets, where availability of funds from the bank loan and public debt markets was limited at a time when cash flow was under pressure, might compromise our ability to implement current long-term strategies.
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual financial obligations resulting in a loss to the group. Credit risk arises from cash balances, credit exposures to customers including outstanding receivables, derivative financial instruments, and financial guarantees. Credit risk is managed at both a group and business level according to internal guidelines, with businesses responsible for their exposure to customer credit risk. Financial transactions are dealt through financial institutions with a credit rating of A or better.
Details of the group's accounting and risk management policies with respect to financial instruments and the associated quantitative and qualitative disclosures are set out in note 25 on pages 90 to 102.

This report sets out the policy and disclosures on directors' remuneration as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 issued under the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act').
In accordance with the Act, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Company. The vote will have advisory status in respect of the remuneration policy and overall remuneration packages and will not be specific to individual levels of remuneration. KPMG Audit Plc has audited the report to the extent required by the Act, being the sections entitled ‘Directors' remuneration', ‘Long-term incentives', ‘Directors' pensions' and ‘Directors' share options'.

3. Directors' remuneration policy
</p>
<p id="page40p13" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to:
• provide alignment between remuneration and the Company's business objectives;
• align executive rewards with shareholder value;
• attract and retain high-calibre executive directors;
• motivate executive directors to achieve challenging performance levels and reward them for so doing;
• recognise both individual and corporate achievement; and
• reflect the diversity of the group's interests.
The total remuneration of executive directors comprises base salary, annual and long-term incentives, pension provisions and other benefits.
During 2009, the Remuneration committee reviewed the incentive arrangements for executive directors and other senior executives and concluded that the current arrangements were working satisfactorily. The only change has been a minor alteration to the financial measures in the annual bonus, such that working capital targets will be more stretching in the future.
The Remuneration committee continues to believe that a substantial element of compensation should be ‘at risk' in order to reward and drive performance and to align better the interests of executives with those of shareholders. The current proportion of variable pay in the form of annual performance bonus and long-term incentives compared to base salary for executive directors is around 1.3 to 1 for ‘on target' performance.
Other executives are eligible to participate in incentive arrangements similar to those of the executive directors, and based on the same principles, but with lower levels of potential payout. The current proportion of variable pay to base salary for first line executives is around 0.8 to 1 for ‘on target' performance.
</p>
<p id="page40p14" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Base salary
</p>
<p id="page40p15" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Base salaries are paid to individuals for delivering a fully competent level of performance, and are reviewed in relation to median market data for comparable companies in terms of size, market sector and complexity. Other considerations are individual experience, performance and scope of responsibility. Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities. The committee also takes into account pay and employment conditions of employees in the Company and of other undertakings in the same group as the Company when determining directors' remuneration.

Annual performance bonus
</p>
<p id="page41p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Executive directors and other senior executives are eligible to participate in an annual cash-based bonus scheme with payments based on the achievement of stretching financial targets and personal performance assessed against individual short and medium-term objectives. Financial targets for all ABF executives are set on a business-by-business basis and reflect what can be directly influenced and the area of work for which each executive is accountable. Adjusted operating profit and working capital were chosen as the prime financial measures as they are common metrics which are used on a day-to-day basis to drive and monitor performance within the group.
At the start of the financial year, budgeted operating profit is set as the ‘on target'
performance level, and the Remuneration committee determines the range of operating profit at which the minimum and maximum incentive payouts will be made. Similarly the target and range for working capital as a percentage of sales is determined, and this acts as a multiplier to the bonus achieved for adjusted operating profit, whereby that bonus can be enhanced or reduced by up to 20%.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 150% of base salary. Up to 20% may be paid for achievement of specific personal objectives and up to 130% may be paid for achievement of financial results as outlined above. ‘On target' performance yields around 78% of base salary.
</p>
<p id="page41p5" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Long-term incentives
</p>
<p id="page41p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Long-term incentives are paid in shares to reward long-term business growth and to promote executive retention. The Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive
Plan 2003 (‘the Share Incentive Plan') was established following shareholder approval at the 2003 annual general meeting. Under this scheme, long-term awards are made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares which are released if, and to the extent that, performance targets are satisfied over a specified three-year period.
As a result of the review of total remuneration undertaken in 2006, revised incentive plan arrangements were introduced in September 2006, and for the first time it was agreed that executive directors should be granted an annual allocation of conditional shares thus creating a series of overlapping three-year performance periods.

Under the terms of the Scheme, the fourth allocation of conditional shares, to a maximum face value of 125% of base salary, will be made on or after 23 November 2009. The committee has reviewed the performance criteria and has determined that this allocation will again be measured against compound annual growth in adjusted earnings per share, in the range of 5% to 11% at the end of the performance period in September 2012.

4. Directors' remuneration
</p>
<p id="page42p9" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Executive directors' salaries were reviewed on 1 December 2008 in accordance with normal policy. George Weston's salary was increased by 4.24% to £860,000 and John Bason's salary was increased by 5.0% to £577,500. Executive directors' salaries are next subject to review on 1 December 2009 but increases, if any, are expected to be modest.
The board reviews non-executive directors' fees periodically in the light of fees payable in comparable companies and the importance attached to the retention and attraction of high-calibre individuals as non-executive directors. Fees are paid on a per annum basis and are not varied for the number of days worked.
The current fee for a non-executive director is £54,000 per annum. The chairman of the Audit committee and the Senior Independent Director are paid an additional fee of £10,000 per annum. The Chairman is paid an annual fee of £300,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Company's annual or long-term incentive plans and take no part in any discussion or decision concerning their own fees.
No adjustments were made to the fees in December 2008, but the next review will take place in December 2009.
The remuneration paid to all directors for the year to 12 September 2009 was as follows: For the year to 12 September 2009

The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary, defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary. The Company pension schemes are HMRC approved but the executive directors also have entitlements under employer-financed arrangements which are unregistered.

There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted:

• The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (‘the 2000 Scheme'), under which options granted become exercisable by participants after an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied.

8. Directors' service contracts
</p>
<p id="page45p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
It is the Company's policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods. The Company's Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting.
Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year ended 12 September 2009 are set out below: Effective date Notice Notice

* Martin Adamson retired as non-executive Chairman on 21 April 2009.
** Charles Sinclair's notice period will reduce to six months from April 2010.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to the security of 12 months' notice of termination of employment is in line with the practice of many comparable companies.
The Remuneration committee's aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation. The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors' service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.

Significant agreements

<p id="page48p5" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by various banking groups.
These facility agreements generally include change of control provisions which, in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, could result in their renegotiation or withdrawal. The most significant agreements are the US$1.2bn syndicated loan facility which was signed on 12 October 2006 and under which £211m was drawn down at the year end, the £320m syndicated loan facility which was signed on 14 October 2008 and under which no funds were drawn down at the year end and the £120m Finance Contract from the European Investment
Bank which was signed on 5 December 2007 and under which £120m was drawn down at the year end.
In addition to these bank facilities, in March 2009 the Company issued US$610m of private placement notes to institutional investors. In accordance with the scheduled maturities, no repayment of these notes had taken place by the year end. In the event of a change in ownership of the Company, the Company is obliged to make an offer of immediate repayment to the note holders.
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and joint venture agreements. None is considered to be significant in terms of its potential impact on the business of the group as a whole.

Such contracts and arrangements may be deemed essential to one or more operating companies but there are no contracts or arrangements considered to be essential to the group as a whole. Through the British Sugar IPA Agreement via the National Farmers
Union, approximately 1,000 individual contracts with sugar beet growers are created.

Directors' report // Governance // Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the annual report and the financial statements
</p>
<p id="page50p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will continue in business.
</p>
<p id="page50p5" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' report, Remuneration report and Corporate governance report that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Associated British Foods plc (‘the Company') is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 12 September 2009 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the group') and the group's interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 3 November 2009.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS').
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice. These are presented on pages 107 to 111.
</p>
<p id="page56p6" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Basis of preparation
</p>
<p id="page56p7" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest million. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that biological assets and certain financial instruments are stated at their fair value. Assets classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements under Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Judgements made by management in the application of Adopted IFRS that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment next year, are discussed in note 31.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised from the period in which the estimates are revised.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied to all periods presented.
Details of new accounting standards which came into force in the year are set out at the end of this note. None of them required restatement of primary statements in comparative periods, nor had any significant impact on the group's consolidated results or financial position.
The financial statements of the group are prepared for the 52 weeks ended 12 September 2009, except that, to avoid delay in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the results of certain subsidiaries are included up to 31 August 2009. The results of Illovo are included for the period to 30 September 2009 in line with Illovo's local reporting date. Adjustments are made as appropriate for significant transactions or events occurring between 31 August and 30 September.
</p>
<p id="page56p8" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Basis of consolidation
</p>
<p id="page56p9" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company and all of its subsidiaries from the date that control commences to the date that control ceases.
The consolidated financial statements also include the group's share of the after-tax results of its jointly controlled entities and associates on an equity-accounted basis from the point at which joint control or significant influence respectively commences, to the date that it ceases.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Jointly controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the group has joint control, typically established by contractual agreement.
Associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.

Business combinations
</p>
<p id="page56p11" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
On the acquisition of a business or an interest in a joint venture or associate, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition. Adjustments to fair values include those made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the group.
Provisional fair values subsequently finalised are adjusted by restatement of the comparative period in which the acquisition occurred.

<p id="page56p12" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Revenue
</p>
<p id="page56p13" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Revenue represents the net invoiced value of goods delivered to customers, excluding sales taxes. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying products have been substantially transferred to the customer. Revenue is stated net of price discounts, certain promotional activities and similar items.

Borrowing costs
</p>
<p id="page56p15" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Borrowing costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method.

Exceptional items
</p>
<p id="page57p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expenditure which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement in accordance with IAS 1.
</p>
<p id="page57p5" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Foreign currencies
</p>
<p id="page57p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
In individual companies, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Any resulting differences are taken to the income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange other than substantial transactions, which are translated at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction.
Differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of group companies, together with differences arising from the restatement of the net results of group companies from average or actual rates to rates at the balance sheet date, are taken to the translation reserve.
</p>
<p id="page57p7" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
</p>
<p id="page57p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group's principal pension funds are defined benefit plans. In addition the group has defined contribution plans and other unfunded post-employment liabilities.
For defined benefit plans, the amount charged in the income statement is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members by the group during the year. It also includes a credit equivalent to the group's expected return on pension plan assets over the year, offset by a charge equal to the expected interest on plan liabilities over the year. For each of the group's plans, the difference between the market value of assets and the present value of liabilities is disclosed as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Any related deferred tax (to the extent it is recoverable) is disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheet. Any actuarial gains or losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense. Surpluses on defined benefit plans are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable. Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately as an actuarial gain or loss in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Contributions payable by the group in respect of defined contribution plans are charged to operating profit as incurred. Other unfunded post-employment liabilities are accounted for in the same way as defined benefit pension plans.
</p>
<p id="page57p9" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Share-based payments: employee benefits
</p>
<p id="page57p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The Share Incentive Plan allows executives to receive allocations of shares to be distributed subject to attainment of certain financial performance criteria and typically after a three-year performance period. The fair value of the shares to be awarded is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the shares. The fair value of the shares allocated is measured taking into account the terms and conditions under which the shares were allocated. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest.
The Share Option Scheme (1994) and Executive Share Option Scheme (2000) allow executives to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.

Income tax
</p>
<p id="page57p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Income tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items taken directly to reserves.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than those acquired in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.

Financial assets and liabilities
</p>
<p id="page58p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Financial assets and financial liabilities, except for certain non-current other receivables, other current investments and derivative financial instruments, are measured initially at fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs, and thereafter at amortised cost. Certain non-current other receivables comprise available-for-sale investments which are measured at market prices where available. Where quoted market prices in an active market are not available, and where fair value cannot be reliably measured, unquoted equity instruments are measured at cost less impairment. Other current investments (classified under other financial assets) are designated as ‘at fair value through profit and loss' because they are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the group's risk management and investment strategy.
</p>
<p id="page58p7" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Cash and cash equivalents
</p>
<p id="page58p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Cash and cash equivalents comprise bank and cash balances, call deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
</p>
<p id="page58p9" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Derivative financial instruments
</p>
<p id="page58p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the group's economic exposure to financial and commodity risks. The principal instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts, futures, swaps or options (the ‘hedging instrument'). The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet, within other financial assets and liabilities, at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is based on market rates or calculated using either discounted cash flow or option pricing models consistently applied for similar types of instrument. These calculations take into consideration management's best estimates and assumptions based on market-related data at the balance sheet date.
The gain or loss on subsequent fair value measurement is recognised in the income statement unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, when recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The purpose of hedge accounting is to mitigate the impact on the group's income statement of changes in foreign exchange or interest rates and commodity prices, by matching the impact of the hedged risk and the hedging instrument in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is applied to derivatives that are expected to be effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions (the ‘hedged item'). To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. At inception of the transaction, the group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. This includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions. The group also documents its assessment, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been, and are likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in equity in the hedging reserve. The ineffective part of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within operating profit in the income statement.
When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. Otherwise, gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, for forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. Gains or losses on hedging instruments that relate to an underlying exposure that no longer exists are taken directly to the income statement.
Hedges of the group's net investment in foreign operations take the form of borrowings in the currency of the investment's net assets.
The group economically hedges foreign currency exposure on recognised monetary assets and liabilities but does not normally seek hedge accounting under IAS 39.
Any derivatives that the group holds to hedge this exposure are classified as ‘held for trading' within other financial assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of such derivatives and the foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the related monetary items are recognised within operating profit in the income statement.

Intangible assets other than goodwill
</p>
<p id="page59p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Non-operating intangible assets are intangible assets that arise on business combinations and typically include intellectual property, brands, customer relationships and grower agreements.
Operating intangible assets are intangible assets acquired in the ordinary course of business and typically include software costs and expenditure in relation to the purchase of additional sugar quota.
Intangible assets other than goodwill that have a finite life are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Intangible assets other than goodwill that do not have a finite life are stated at cost less impairment charges and are subject to an annual impairment test.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement within operating costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are generally deemed to be no longer than: Customer relationships up to 5 years Grower agreements up to 10 years Technology and brands up to 15 years
</p>
<p id="page59p5" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Goodwill
</p>
<p id="page59p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 3 September 2004, goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, including separately identified intangible assets. In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, represented by the net book value recorded under previous GAAP. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 3 September 2004 was not reconsidered on transition to IFRS.
Certain commercial assets associated with the acquisition of a business are not capable of being recognised in the acquisition balance sheet. In such circumstances, goodwill is recognised, which may include, but is not necessarily limited to, workforce assets and the benefits of expected future synergies.
Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment test.
</p>
<p id="page59p7" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Research and development
</p>
<p id="page59p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
</p>
<p id="page59p9" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Impairment
</p>
<p id="page59p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The carrying amounts of the group's intangible assets and property, plant &amp; equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangibles without a finite life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment charge is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment charges are recognised in the income statement within operating costs.
Impairment charges recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit (or group of units) and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro rata basis.
</p>
<p id="page59p11" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Calculation of recoverable amount
</p>
<p id="page59p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
</p>
<p id="page59p13" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Reversals of impairment
</p>
<p id="page59p14" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
An impairment charge in respect of goodwill is not subsequently reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment charge is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount. An impairment charge is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment charge had been recognised.

Items of property, plant &amp; equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant &amp; equipment sufficient to reduce them to their estimated residual value.

Leases
</p>
<p id="page60p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
A lease is defined as an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee, in return for a payment or a series of payments, the right to use a specific asset for an agreed period of time.
Where the group is a lessee and has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the arrangement is considered a finance lease. Finance leases are recognised as assets of the group within property, plant &amp; equipment at the inception of the lease at the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned assets. Payments made under finance leases are apportioned between capital repayments and interest expense charged to the income statement. Other leases where the group is a lessee are treated as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The benefit of lease incentives is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Where the group is a lessor and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to a lessee, the arrangement is considered a finance lease.
For finance leases, capital amounts due from lessees are recognised as financial assets of the group within trade and other receivables at the inception of the lease at the amount of the net investment in the lease after making provision for bad and doubtful debts. Payments received under finance leases are apportioned between capital repayments and interest income credited to the income statement. Other leases where the group is a lessor are treated as operating leases. For operating leases, the asset is capitalised within property, plant &amp; equipment and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Biological assets
</p>
<p id="page60p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Cane roots and growing cane are stated at fair value determined on the following bases: Cane roots - the escalated average cost, using appropriate inflation-related indices, of each year of planting adjusted for the remaining expected life. Expected useful lives are currently ten years in South Africa, seven years in Zambia and eight years in each of the other countries of operation.
Growing cane - the estimated sucrose content valued at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport.
When harvested, growing cane is transferred to inventory at fair value less costs to sell.

Inventories
</p>
<p id="page60p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and expenses, an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads, but not borrowing costs. Cost is calculated on a first-in first-out basis.

The following interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC') are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position: IFRIC 12 - Service concession agreements
IFRIC 13 - Customer loyalty programmes
IFRIC 14 - IAS 19: The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction
The following standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB') or the IFRIC have not yet been adopted by the group: Amendment to IFRS 3 - Business combinations and IAS 27 - Consolidated and separate financial statements (effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009).
These revised standards implement substantial revisions in the application of acquisition accounting, notably with respect to the treatment of acquisition costs, step and partial acquisitions, minority interests and contingent consideration. The group has reviewed these changes and, with the exception of the requirement to expense acquisition costs, does not expect them to have a material impact on the group's results.
IFRS 8 - Operating segments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
This standard contains requirements for the disclosure of information about an entity's operating segments and also about the entity's products and services, the geographical areas in which it operates, and its major customers. The standard is concerned only with disclosure and replaces IAS 14 - Segment reporting.
The standard is not expected to have a material effect on the disclosure of the group's operating segments.
Amendment to IAS 23 - Borrowing costs (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).
The amendment to IAS 23 generally eliminates the option to expense as incurred borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, and instead requires the capitalisation of such borrowing costs as part of the cost of specific assets. The group does not expect these changes to have a material effect on the group's results.
IFRIC 16 - Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 October 2008).
The IFRIC clarifies certain aspects of IAS 39 with respect to hedge accounting. The impact of this interpretation on the group's financial statements is not expected to be material.
IAS 1 (Revised) - Presentation of financial statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, endorsed by the EU in December 2008).
IAS 27 (Revised) - Consolidated and separate financial statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, endorsed by the EU in June 2009).
Amendments to IFRS 7 - Improving disclosures about financial instruments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009, not yet endorsed by the EU) requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements of financial instruments by using a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The amended standard also requires improved disclosure in respect of liquidity risk. The group is currently assessing the impact that these amendments will have on the group's disclosures.
The group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations issued by the IASB or the IFRIC, either applicable in the current year or not yet applicable, have, or will have, a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Segment reporting is presented in respect of the group's business and geographical segments. The primary format, business segments, is based on the group's management and internal reporting structure and combines businesses with common characteristics. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm's length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate assets and expenses, cash, borrowings, employee benefit balances and current and deferred tax balances. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year.

In 2008, an exceptional credit of £25m arose in British Sugar comprising compensation receivable for quota renunciation less factory closure costs and the write-off of the unamortised cost of quota purchased in 2006. The compensation was received in full in 2009.
An exceptional charge of £71m was made for the cost of business restructuring, principally the Australian meat and dairy business following the acquisition of KR Castlemaine. These costs comprised severance costs, impairment of property, plant &amp; equipment and other closure costs.
A tax credit of £23m arose on the above exceptional items. Following a change in tax law in the UK Finance Act 2008, Industrial Buildings Allowances are being phased out. An exceptional tax charge of £17m reflected the consequential increase in the group's deferred tax liability.

7. Earnings per share
</p>
<p id="page68p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 12 September 2009 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of £359m (2008 - £357m), and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 789 million (2008 - 790 million). The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on the sale of property, plant &amp; equipment and businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, the inventory fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Azucarera, exceptional items and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options and share incentives. The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 789 million (2008 - 790 million). There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Goodwill
As at 12 September 2009, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of £1,291m. Goodwill is allocated to the group's cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows:

* The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs is not individually significant.
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
These calculations are performed annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
• The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reflecting the projected cash flows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs based on the most recent budget. Growth rates for the period not covered by the budget are based on a range of growth rates that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
• The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
• The cash flow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the group's pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks of the business if necessary. The rates used vary between 8% and 11%.
• The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5%.
• For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region. In these circumstances, the cash flow forecast is extended to between three and five years using specific growth assumptions.
• Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
</p>
<p id="page70p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Each of the group's CGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review with the exception of the recently acquired sugar business in north east China.
A significant national sugar stock overhang from 2007/8, depressed prices and a reduced crop in the north with exceptionally low sugar content impacted operating costs.
Current forecasts support the carrying value of the assets of the business but the achievement of these forecasts depends on the recovery of sugar prices, improvements in agricultural yields, and higher factory volumes.

The group operates pension schemes, the majority of which are of the defined benefit type. The group also operates a small number of unfunded overseas post-retirement medical benefit schemes.

UK schemes
</p>
<p id="page74p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group's principal UK defined benefit pension schemes are funded schemes and are closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements in place for other employees. The pension costs in the UK for the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method. For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense, and are reflected in the balance sheet at 12 September 2009. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested.
The last actuarial valuation of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2008. At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Scheme was £2,223m and represented 93% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the actuarial valuation, the group agreed to make five annual payments of £30m in order to eliminate the deficit at 5 April 2008. The first of these payments was made in March 2009.

The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, the Philippines, Thailand, South Africa and Zambia. These schemes are primarily funded schemes. The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries. Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes. For defined contribution schemes, the pension costs are the contributions payable.

Assumptions
</p>
<p id="page74p12" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The UK pension schemes represent 90% (2008 - 91%) of both the group's scheme assets and scheme liabilities. The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, are:
</p>
<p id="page74p13" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
2009 2008 2007
% % %
Discount rate
5.7 6.0 5.8
Inflation
3.5 3.7 3.3
Rate of increase in salaries
5.0 5.2 4.8
Rate of increase for pensions in payment
3.3 3.5 3.1
Rate of increase for pensions in deferment (where provided)
3.5 3.7 3.3
</p>
<p id="page74p14" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 generational mortality tables with medium cohort improvements and an underpin improvement, as published by the Institute of Actuaries. These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2009 2008 life expectancy from age 65 (in years)
Male Female Male Female
Member aged 65 in 2009
20.8 22.7 20.7 22.6
Member aged 65 in 2029
22.6 24.2 22.5 24.1
</p>
<p id="page74p15" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data. The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.

(a) The surplus in the plans is only recoverable to the extent that the group can benefit from either refunds formally agreed or future contribution reductions.
The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The UK schemes' net pension liability of £76m (2008 - £85m asset) plus the overseas schemes' net pension liability of £30m (2008 - £24m liability) totals a liability of £106m (2008 - £61m asset). This equates to the employee benefits asset of £16m (2008 - £106m) and liability of £122m (2008 - £45m) shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.

The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned. Other deferred tax assets totalling £11m
(2008 - £6m) have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
In addition, there are temporary differences of £1,778m (2008 - £1,460m) relating to investments in subsidiaries. No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

During the period, the group completed the acquisition of the Iberian sugar business, Azucarera Ebro, together with a small feed mill in the UK and a sugar cane farm in Zambia, as well as a number of other small acquisitions. Costs associated with these acquisitions are included within cash and deferred consideration. Deferred consideration was paid in respect of the beet sugar operations acquired in north east China last year.

The differences between pre-acquisition carrying amounts and amounts recognised on acquisition, which include fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities acquired, are £49m of intangibles recognised, a £16m upward adjustment to property, plant &amp; equipment, a £5m upward adjustment to biological assets, a £13m revaluation of inventories (including £12m in respect of the Azucarera acquisition) and a £14m adjustment to deferred tax.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability from the sale of the group's existing products in new markets, and the anticipated future technological and operational synergies from the combinations.
The acquisitions in aggregate contributed revenue of £136m and adjusted profit before tax of £1m for the period between the dates of acquisition and 12 September 2009.
Aggregate contributions to revenue and profit before tax had the acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the period have not been disclosed, as appropriately consolidated financial information prepared under Adopted IFRS is not available.
The net cash of £249m in the acquisition table above differs from the cash flow on purchase of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement by £17m. The difference relates to amounts paid for investments in joint ventures.
The goodwill of £18m in the acquisition table above differs from the amount shown for business combinations in note 8 by £10m. This relates to the loss on disposal of the manufacturing plant in Portugal, included in the disposals table in this note, which has been treated as goodwill arising on the acquisition of the remaining Gilde businesses.

The acquisition of Azucarera was completed on 30 April 2009. It contributed a net profit of £1m to the consolidated adjusted net profit for the year since acquisition date. The contribution to consolidated revenues and net profit had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year has not been disclosed, as it would be impractical to determine these amounts. This is because the entity acquired did not prepare consolidated financial statements and reported to a 31 December year end.

During 2008, the group completed the merger of Ryvita and Jordans and the acquisition of certain of the European assets of Gilde Bakery Ingredients, 11 beet sugar factories in north east China and the KR Castlemaine meat and smallgoods business in Australia.

Provisions made on sale and closure of businesses of £65m comprise £37m of PP&amp;E impairment (see note 9), £6m of operating intangible impairment (see note 8) and £22m of other rationalisation costs.
In August 2009, agreement was reached to sell the Polish sugar business, completion of which is subject to competition clearance. Assets and liabilities of this business have been included in the consolidated balance sheet as ‘held for sale' pending competition clearance.
The net cash of £22m in the disposal table above differs from the cash flow on sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shown in the cash flow statement by £123m. Of this difference, £122m relates to advance consideration received in respect of the agreement to dispose of the Polish sugar business, as described above.
The remaining £1m was received in respect of a reduction in stake in a joint venture.

Fair values
</p>
<p id="page87p11" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The weighted average fair values for the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were determined using a binomial lattice model (for share options) or by taking the market price of the shares at the time of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period (for conditional allocations of shares).
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was 610 pence (2008 - 837 pence) and the weighted average share price was 656 pence (2008 - 900 pence). The dividend yield used was 2.5%.
No options were granted under the 1994 Scheme or the 2000 Scheme in either 2008 or 2009.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants under these plans made after 7 November 2002 and unvested at 18 September 2004. The group recognised a total equity-settled share-based payment expense of £5m (2008 - £5m).

The financial instruments shown above include £17m trade and other receivables (2008 - £nil), £8m cash and cash equivalents and £21m trade and other payables
(2008 - £nil) that are classified as held for sale at year end.
Other financial assets on the face of the balance sheet comprise other current investments and derivative assets. Other financial liabilities comprise derivative liabilities.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: 1. Cash and cash equivalents have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities or otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
2. Other non-current investments (recorded within other non-current receivables) comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them. Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost. Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price is used to estimate fair value.
3. The fair values of finance lease receivables and other long-term receivables have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows.
4. The fair values of trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
5. Other current investments primarily comprise debt securities and time deposits, which are stated at fair value, based on cost (for instruments similar in nature to cash and cash equivalents) or on current market prices.
6. The fair value of derivatives is determined either by reference to third-party valuations (usually from a bank), or by reference to readily observable market prices.
The group's derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is therefore almost always available to assist with the valuation of derivatives.
7. The fair values of trade payables, other payables and accruals have been stated at their book values due to their short maturities.
8. The fair values of all bank loans, overdrafts and debenture stock have been calculated using the present value of estimated future cash flows.
9. The fair values of finance lease creditors have been estimated by discounting expected cash flows.
10. Provisions are measured at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Consequently, the fair value has been presented as book value.

d) Financial risk identification and management
</p>
<p id="page90p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The group's financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the group's activities. The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in a wide variety of locations around the world. These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets. Trading and risk management teams have been established in the group's major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures, and, where appropriate, options. These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executive management.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the group's financial and commodity risks. Treasury works closely with the group's procurement teams to manage commodity risks. Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the group's businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk. The group's risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives (outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks) for speculative purposes.

e) Foreign currency translation
</p>
<p id="page91p5" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group presents its financial statements in sterling. As a result of its diverse worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations. This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings, and where they are not in sterling, these borrowings are designated as net investment hedges. This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to equity, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement (other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings), nor does it use derivatives to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
The group also designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21. The effect of the designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and/or the lending entity is accounted for directly within equity.
The group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in euros and US dollars. The value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2009 2008 £m £m

f) Market risk
</p>
<p id="page91p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These risks are known as ‘transaction' (or recognised)
exposures and ‘economic' (or forecast) exposures.
(i) Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business. Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices. The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the group's risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury. Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers' pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the group's overall pricing strategy.
Some of the group's commodity derivatives are treated as ‘own use' contracts, which are outside the scope of IAS 39, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the group's ordinary operations, and are not net settled (the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned). ‘Own use' contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises. Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the forecast transaction is highly probable and the hedge is assessed as effective. The group obtains hedge accounting for the majority of these contracts. Some commodity derivatives are not eligible for treatment as ‘own use' contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting under IAS 39 are able to be satisfied. This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned. While such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure, formal hedge accounting may not be possible for reasons including: where the derivatives are in respect of a similar but different commodity to that being hedged; where exchange-traded derivatives are used that are not sufficiently close in all respects (for example quality attributes) to the business requirement; or where the exchange used is foreign to the business. Where hedge accounting for commodity derivatives within the scope of IAS 39 is not available, the instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the group's forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.

Sensitivity analysis
</p>
<p id="page92p7" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the group's results and the group's equity of changes in commodity market prices as a result of entering into financial instruments (including derivatives). The only financial assets and liabilities expected to show any sensitivity in this respect are commodity derivatives.
The sensitivity chosen is a 20% increase in the forward curves for various commodity prices as if they had occurred on 12 September 2009. For as long as the group continues to make limited use of options, a 20% decrease in forward prices would produce a broadly equal and opposite impact on profit and equity to that shown.
The movement of forward price curves by 20% is considered to be a reasonable approximation of how much markets might typically move, on average, over any given year, notwithstanding that the increases in some commodity prices during the past year have been significantly greater than this.
The sensitivity analysis addresses the impact on year end financial assets and liabilities, and is not an estimate of what profit might have been if commodity prices had been uniformly different throughout the year.
The following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of these sensitivities, which are presented before taxation and minority interests:
• all qualifying cash flow hedges at 12 September 2009 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting; and
• commodity contracts that qualify for the ‘own use' treatment continue to do so. This sensitivity therefore has no impact for these contracts.

</p>
<p id="page92p9" lang="en" fontname="OIQWTF+FSAlbert-LightItalic">
(ii) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements:
• interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing fixed interest rates. Changes in floating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these fixed rate financial instruments; and
• interest cash flow risk results from financial instruments bearing floating rates. Changes in floating interest rates affect cash flows on interest receivable or payable.
The group's policy is to maintain floating rate debt for the majority of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk and interest rate swaps are sometimes entered into in more volatile markets.
At 12 September 2009, £592m (43%) (2008 - £222m and 19%) of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest. The group's fixed rate debt includes the US Private
Placement loan of £378m (2008 - £nil) and the £150m 10 3 / 4 % secured redeemable debenture stock 2013 (2008 - £150m).
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates
(eg LIBOR).

Sensitivity analysis
</p>
<p id="page92p11" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Applying a 100 basis point parallel increase in the interest rate yield curve as if it had occurred on 12 September 2009 results in no impact on profit for the year or total equity (2008 - no impact on profit or total equity). The following assumptions have been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests:
• the impact of this sensitivity has only been recorded for changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which have their fair value gains and losses recorded within the financial statements, assets available for sale, and other current investments, as the group does not designate any other financial asset at fair value through profit or loss and these are the only significant financial instruments whose carrying amounts change as a result of changes in interest rates. All other financial instruments are carried at amortised cost;
• no impact is recorded in respect of changes in interest rates on employee benefits (including pensions), or discount rates applied to financial instruments to record them at present value; and
• all qualifying cash flow hedges at 12 September 2009 will continue to be fully effective in achieving cash flow hedge accounting.

<p id="page93p4" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
A second sensitivity analysis calculates the impact on profitability of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on floating rate interest-bearing loans and overdrafts, and on cash and cash equivalents balances on which variable rates of interest are earned. The year end cash balance is deducted from the year end floating rate loans and overdrafts balance. This net floating rate borrowing figure is multiplied by 1%. In 2009, this equated to an interest expense of £4m before taxation and minority interests (2008 - £6m). (iii) Foreign currency risk
The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies. As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the group's transaction costs. The group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e) above.
</p>
<p id="page93p5" lang="en" fontname="OIQWTF+FSAlbert-LightItalic">
Transaction risk
</p>
<p id="page93p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency. It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas. The group's policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance. Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives (principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options) to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables. The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges. Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement. This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
</p>
<p id="page93p7" lang="en" fontname="OIQWTF+FSAlbert-LightItalic">
Economic (forecast) risk
</p>
<p id="page93p8" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12 month basis. The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the group's risk management policies and prevailing market conditions. The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges. To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The majority of the group's currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group's most significant currency transaction exposures are:
• sugar prices in British Sugar UK and Poland to movements in the sterling/euro and Polish zloty/euro exchange rates respectively;
• sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand/US dollar/euro exchange rates; and
• sourcing for Primark - costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies (primarily US dollars and euros), giving rise to transaction exposures. In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.

Sensitivity analysis
</p>
<p id="page95p6" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact that a 10% strengthening of the group's operating currencies against local functional currencies would have had on profit and equity. The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses' financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses. A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the group's main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The following assumption has been applied in the calculation of this sensitivity, which is presented before taxation and minority interests:
• the exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity (see below for a separate sensitivity).

g) Credit risk
</p>
<p id="page96p7" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Credit risk is the risk that counterparties to financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract or instrument. The group's businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 12 September 2009. The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2009 2008 £m £m

The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
As at 12 September 2009, there were no significant financial guarantees or third-party obligations that increased the credit risk of the financial assets set out above.
Although the group has seen no direct evidence of changes to the credit risk of its counterparties, the current focus on financial liquidity in all international markets has introduced increased financial volatility. The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.

Trade and other receivables
</p>
<p id="page96p10" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the group's large and diverse customer base. The group has established a credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced. This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references. Credit limits are established for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management. Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business. Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually. Customers that fail to meet the group's benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis. Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the group's customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low. Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim. The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data. The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.

Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group. These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses' day-to-day banking requirements. The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury. The group has not recorded impairments against cash, cash equivalents or other current investments, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances. Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.

Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date. No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss, for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due. Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained. Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the group's borrowing facilities are given in section i).

The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at 12 September 2009.
The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on the secured redeemable debenture stock and other fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the group's finance leases, and cash flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

In addition to the above facilities there are also £67m (2008 - £93m) of undrawn and available credit lines for the purposes of issuing letters of credit and guarantees in the normal course of business.
The group also has £13m (2008 - £14m) of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are included in the group's interest-bearing loans and overdrafts in note 18.
In October 2008, the Company negotiated a three-year £320m committed facility with its existing banking group that when added to the existing US$1.2bn of committed bank facilities provide £1,039m of bank finance. Both these facilities mature in October 2011. In addition to the bank debt, in March 2009 the Company issued £378m of private placement notes to institutional investors in the US and Europe. At 12 September 2009, these have an average remaining duration of 6.2 years and an average fixed coupon of 7.1%. The other significant core committed debt facilities comprise a £150m debenture loan and a £120m EIB loan which mature in 2013 and 2015 respectively.
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn at any time.
Refer to note 9 for details of the group's capital commitments and to note 27 for a summary of the group's guarantees. An assessment of the group's current liquidity position is given in the ‘Financial review' section of the annual report on page 25. The uncommitted total facility of £853m in the table above differs from the uncommitted credit lines referred to in the Financial review by £12m. This relates to the net amount of uncleared receipts, recognised in bank overdrafts.

<p id="page100p7" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet. Note 21 provides details on equity and note 18 on loans and overdrafts. Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities.
Longer term funding is sourced from a combination of these facilities, the private placement notes and committed syndicated loan facilities.
The board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable successful future development of the business. The board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level of dividends payable to shareholders.
From time to time the group purchases its own shares in the market. The shares are purchased to satisfy awards under the group's share option scheme and long-term incentive plan. Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market. The group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes to the group's approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Litigation and other proceedings against companies in the group are not considered material in the context of these financial statements.
The group has not adopted the amendments to IAS 39 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other group companies, the group considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such in accordance with IFRS 4. In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the relevant group company issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
As at 12 September 2009, group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to £597m (2008 - £196m).

31. Accounting estimates and judgements
</p>
<p id="page103p8" lang="en" fontname="XPRYPN+FSAlbert-Bold">
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
</p>
<p id="page103p9" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
In applying the accounting policies detailed on pages 58 to 63, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome may differ from those calculated. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on estimates of future cash flows arising from the group's operations which, in some circumstances, are discounted to arrive at a net present value:
• the carrying value of goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually and also when there is an indication that it may be impaired. This assessment involves comparing the book value of goodwill with its recoverable amount (being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell). Value in use is determined with reference to projected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate. Both the projected future cash flows and the discount rate applied involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty; and
• the realisation of deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise. The group recognises deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered, based on an assessment of the likelihood of there being sufficient taxable profits in the future.
Post-retirement benefits
The group's defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19. The accounting valuation, which has been assessed using assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in an asset of £16m and a liability of £122m being recognised as at 12 September 2009.
The size of these assets and liabilities is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes, to the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, to the actuarial assumptions which include price inflation, rates of pension and salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions and to the level of contributions.
Further details are included in note 12.
Provisions
As described in the accounting policies on pages 58 to 63, provisions are measured at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These estimates are made taking into account a range of possible outcomes.

Property, plant &amp; equipment residual values and useful lives
These assets are written down to their estimated residual values over their anticipated useful lives using the straight-line basis. Management reviews residual values annually considering market conditions and projected disposal values. In assessing useful lives, maintenance programmes and technological innovations are considered.
The carrying value of property, plant &amp; equipment is disclosed in note 9.
Biological assets
Cane roots valuation - the escalated average cost of planting cane roots is adjusted for the remaining expected life. This requires an estimation by management of the average number of ratoons expected from the crop. The carrying value of cane roots is disclosed in note 10.
Growing cane valuation - growing cane is valued using the estimated sucrose content at the estimated sucrose price for the following season, less the estimated costs for harvesting and transport. The estimated sucrose content requires management to assess the expected cane and sucrose yields for the following season considering weather conditions and harvesting programmes. In assessing the estimated sucrose price, management is required to assess into which markets the forthcoming crop will be sold and assess domestic and export prices as well as the related foreign currency exchange rates. The carrying value of growing cane is disclosed in note 10.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The group enters into various types of hedging or forward contracts for the buying and selling of currencies and commodities. The contracts often fall within the scope of IAS 39 and accordingly have to be marked to market. Where appropriate, these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, which allows, to the extent the hedges are effective, the change in values of the derivatives to be deferred in equity. In order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for the group to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable and whether the hedge is effective. This requires both subjective and objective measures of determination.
Exceptional items
The directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their nature and amount should be disclosed separately if the financial statements are to fairly present the financial position and financial performance of the entity. The directors label these items collectively as ‘exceptional items'. Determining which transactions are to be considered exceptional in nature is often a subjective matter. However, circumstances that the directors believe would give rise to exceptional items for separate disclosure might include major business restructurings, impairments and reversals of impairments.
All exceptional items are included in the appropriate income statement line item to which they relate. In addition, for clarity, separate disclosure is made of all exceptional items in one column on the face of the income statement, with additional explanation in the notes.
Taxation
The income tax expense recorded in the income statement is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, unless new tax rates have been enacted or substantively enacted.
The level of current and deferred tax recognised is also dependent on subjective judgements as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the group operates. It is necessary to consider the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised based on an assessment of the extent to which they are regarded as recoverable.
Fair values on acquisition
The group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. Items of plant and equipment and the associated property interests often have long operating lives, hence determination of the fair values can require a significant degree of judgement. Acquisitions often also result in significant intangible benefits being brought into the group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets. Other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of accounting standards and form part of goodwill. Significant judgement can be required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, often with reference to internal data and models. Professional valuers are engaged where it is deemed appropriate to do so. Fair values on major acquisitions are disclosed in note 22.

Intangible assets - goodwill

Intangible assets consist of goodwill arising on acquisitions since 17 September 1998, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration of businesses over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is capitalised in accordance with FRS 10 and amortised over its useful life, not exceeding 20 years. Goodwill previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits

The Company operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable. The principal defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme and the Company is unable to identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. Hence, contributions to this scheme are accounted for as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme.
The Company has one small unfunded defined benefit scheme which it accounts for in accordance with FRS 17 using the advice of professional actuaries. The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members during the year.
It also includes a charge equal to the expected interest on plan liabilities over the year. The present value of plan liabilities is disclosed as a liability on the balance sheet net of any related deferred tax.

Share-based payments
</p>
<p id="page106p16" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
The Share Incentive Plan allows employees of the Company to receive allocations of shares to be distributed subject to attainment of certain financial performance criteria and typically after a three-year performance period. The fair value of the shares to be awarded is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The fair value of the shares allocated is measured taking into account the terms and conditions under which the shares were allocated. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest.
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as for allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The Share Option Scheme (1994) and Executive Share Option Scheme (2000) allow executives to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Shares in the Company are held in a separate trust and are shown at cost as a deduction in arriving at equity shareholders' funds.

7. Contingent liabilities
</p>
<p id="page108p14" lang="en" fontname="YXBEDL+FSAlbert-Light">
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. The guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company has provided £283m of guarantees in the ordinary course of business as at 12 September 2009 (2008 - £nil). These relate primarily to insurance payment obligations, the deferred consideration received described in note 5, and the fulfilment of obligations to the Rural Payments Agency in respect of income received by a subsidiary under the Sugar Restructuring Aid Scheme. The guarantee relating to deferred consideration expires in March 2010. The guarantee to the Rural Payments
Agency is expected to be required until June 2010, when the Company expects the subsidiary to have fulfilled its obligations under the Scheme.

The Company had an average of 98 employees in 2009 (2008 - 91).
The Company is a member of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme, providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. Prior to 6 April 2006 some of the employees of the Company were members of the British Sugar Pension Scheme. On 6 April 2006, the British Sugar Pension Scheme was merged with the Associated
British Foods Pension Scheme. Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme's assets and liabilities on a consistent basis, as permitted by FRS 17, the scheme is accounted for by the Company as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
On 30 September 2002 the Scheme was closed to new members, with defined contribution arrangements introduced for these members. For the defined contribution scheme, the pension costs are the contributions payable.
The last actuarial valuation of the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2008. At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Scheme was £2,223m and represented 93% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. Following completion of the actuarial valuation, the Company agreed to make five annual payments of £30m in order to eliminate the deficit at 5 April 2008. The first of these payments was made in March 2009.
The particulars of the actuarial valuation of the Scheme are contained in note 12 in the consolidated financial statements. There is no material difference in the valuation methodologies under IAS 19 and FRS 17.
